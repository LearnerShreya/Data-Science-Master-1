    "### 1. How do you handle missing values in a Pandas Series in Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "- [ ] By using arithmetic operators or functions.  \n",
    "- [x] **By using functions like `fillna()`, `dropna()`, etc.**  \n",
    "- [ ] By using modules.  \n",
    "- [ ] None of the above.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:** In a Pandas Series, missing values are represented as NaN (Not a Number). You can handle missing values by using functions like `fillna()`, `dropna()`, etc. For example, you can fill missing values with a specific value or drop missing values altogether.\n",
    "\n",

    "### 2. What is a Pandas Series in Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "- [x] **A one-dimensional labeled array capable of holding any data type.**  \n",
    "- [ ] By passing a list, dictionary, or scalar value to the Series() method of the Pandas library.  \n",
    "- [ ] By using arithmetic operators or functions.  \n",
    "- [ ] None of the above.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:** A Pandas Series is a one-dimensional labeled array that can hold any data type, including numerical, string, or even mixed data. It can be created from a list, dictionary, or scalar value and has a label associated with each element, which is known as the index.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. What is the result of the following code?\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import pandas as pd\n",
    "\n",
    "data = {'Name': ['John', 'Jane', 'Jim', 'Joan'],\n",
    "        'Age': [25, 30, 35, 40],\n",
    "        'Occupation': ['Engineer', 'Doctor', 'Teacher', 'Lawyer']}\n",
    "df = pd.DataFrame(data)\n",
    "print(df.loc[0])\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- [x] **Name: John, Age: 25, Occupation: Engineer**  \n",
    "- [ ] Name: John, Age: 25, Occupation: Engineer Name: John, Age: 25, Occupation: Engineer.  \n",
    "- [ ] Name: John, Age: 25.  \n",
    "- [ ] John 25 Engineer.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:** The `loc` accessor of the DataFrame is used to access a row in the DataFrame by its index label. In this case, the code is accessing the row with index label `0`, which returns the first row of the DataFrame with the values of each column for that row.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. What is the Pandas Panel in Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "- [x] **It is a multi-dimensional array data structure used to store and manipulate data in a way that is easy and efficient.**  \n",
    "- [ ] It is a one-dimensional array data structure.  \n",
    "- [ ] Fasten the Strips with Screw Anchors.  \n",
    "- [ ] None of the above.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:** A Panel is a 3-dimensional data structure in Pandas, allowing you to store and manipulate data in a grid-like format. It is a container for multiple DataFrames, each of which can have different dimensions and can store different data types. This makes it an ideal structure for holding multi-dimensional data, such as financial data or survey results.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. How do you create a Pandas Panel in Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "- [ ] Best operator device type.  \n",
    "- [ ] By using the pandas.  \n",
    "- [x] **By using the `pandas.Panel` constructor.**  \n",
    "- [ ] All of the above.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:** To create a Pandas Panel in Python, you can use the `pandas.Panel()` constructor, passing in a data source such as a NumPy array or a dict of DataFrames. You can also specify the axis labels and item labels to help organize your data. Once you have created a Panel, you can use various methods to manipulate and analyze the data, such as indexing, slicing, and aggregating.\n",
