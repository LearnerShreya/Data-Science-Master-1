    "### **1. Which of the following correlation coefficients measures the strength and direction of a linear relationship between two continuous variables?**  \n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **(A) Pearson correlation coefficient**  \n",
    "⬜ **(B) Spearman’s rank correlation**  \n",
    "⬜ **(C) VIF**  \n",
    "⬜ **(D) None of the above**  \n",
    "\n",
    "### **Explanation:**  \n",
    "The **Pearson correlation coefficient** is used to measure the **strength and direction** of a **linear** relationship between two continuous variables. It ranges from **-1 to +1**, where:  \n",
    "- **-1** indicates a perfect negative correlation,  \n",
    "- **0** indicates no correlation, and  \n",
    "- **+1** indicates a perfect positive correlation.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### **Reason for Incorrect Answers:**  \n",
    "- **Spearman’s rank correlation** is used for monotonic relationships, not strictly linear ones.  \n",
    "- **VIF (Variance Inflation Factor)** measures multicollinearity, not correlation.  \n",
    "- **None of the above** is incorrect as Pearson’s coefficient does measure linear correlation.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **2. Which correlation coefficient is appropriate to use when the data is ordinal or non-parametric?**  \n",
    "\n",
    "⬜ **(A) Pearson correlation coefficient**  \n",
    "✅ **(B) Spearman’s rank correlation**  \n",
    "⬜ **(C) VIF**  \n",
    "⬜ **(D) None of the above**  \n",
    "\n",
    "### **Explanation:**  \n",
    "**Spearman’s rank correlation** is a **non-parametric** measure of correlation, making it suitable for **ordinal** or **non-parametric** data. It evaluates the **strength and direction** of a **monotonic** relationship between two continuous or ordinal variables. Unlike Pearson’s correlation, it does not assume a linear relationship.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### **Reason for Incorrect Answers:**  \n",
    "- **Pearson correlation coefficient** is used for continuous variables in a linear relationship, not ordinal data.  \n",
    "- **VIF** is not a correlation measure but is used to detect multicollinearity.  \n",
    "- **None of the above** is incorrect as Spearman’s correlation is the correct choice.  \n",

    "\n",
    "⬜ **(A) 0 to 1**  \n",
    "⬜ **(B) 1 to 10**  \n",
    "✅ **(C) 0 to infinity**  \n",
    "⬜ **(D) None of the above**  \n",
    "\n",
    "### **Explanation:**  \n",
    "**Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) values range from 0 to infinity.**  \n",
    "- **A VIF of 1** indicates no multicollinearity.  \n",
    "- **Higher values (>1)** indicate increasing levels of multicollinearity.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### **Reason for Incorrect Answers:**  \n",
    "- **0 to 1** is incorrect because VIF cannot be less than 1 for real data.  \n",
    "- **1 to 10** is misleading, as VIF can exceed 10.  \n",
    "- **None of the above** is incorrect because the correct range is **0 to infinity**.  \n",

    "### **4. Which of the following correlation coefficients is more robust to outliers?**  \n",
    "\n",
    "⬜ **(A) Pearson correlation coefficient**  \n",
    "✅ **(B) Spearman’s rank correlation**  \n",
    "⬜ **(C) VIF**  \n",
    "⬜ **(D) None of the above**  \n",
    "\n",
    "### **Explanation:**  \n",
    "**Spearman’s rank correlation** is more **robust to outliers** because it is a **non-parametric measure** that uses **ranks** instead of actual values. Since it focuses on the order rather than magnitude, extreme values do not heavily affect the correlation calculation.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### **Reason for Incorrect Answers:**  \n",
    "- **Pearson correlation coefficient** is sensitive to outliers because it directly uses numerical values.  \n",
    "- **VIF** is not a correlation measure but a multicollinearity detector.  \n",
    "- **None of the above** is incorrect as Spearman’s correlation is the correct answer.  \n",

    "### **5. What is the range of the Pearson correlation coefficient?**  \n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **(A) -1 to 1**  \n",
    "⬜ **(B) 0 to 1**  \n",
    "⬜ **(C) -∞ to ∞**  \n",
    "⬜ **(D) None of the above**  \n",
    "\n",
    "### **Explanation:**  \n",
    "The **Pearson correlation coefficient** measures the **linear** relationship between two variables and ranges from **-1 to 1**, where:  \n",
    "- **-1** means perfect negative correlation,  \n",
    "- **0** means no correlation, and  \n",
    "- **1** means perfect positive correlation.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### **Reason for Incorrect Answers:**  \n",
    "- **0 to 1** is incorrect because Pearson’s coefficient can be negative.  \n",
    "- **-∞ to ∞** is incorrect because correlation is always bounded between -1 and 1.  \n",
    "- **None of the above** is incorrect because the correct range is **-1 to 1**.  \n",

    "⬜ **(B) A moderate negative correlation**  \n",
    "✅ **(C) A strong negative correlation**  \n",
    "⬜ **(D) No correlation**  \n",
    "\n",
    "### **Explanation:**  \n",
    "Spearman’s correlation **ranges from -1 to 1**:  \n",
    "- **Negative values** indicate a **negative** correlation.  \n",
    "- **Positive values** indicate a **positive** correlation.  \n",
    "- **A value of -0.85** represents a **strong negative correlation** between the two variables.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### **Reason for Incorrect Answers:**  \n",
    "- **Strong positive correlation** is incorrect because the value is negative.  \n",
    "- **Moderate negative correlation** is incorrect because -0.85 is quite strong.  \n",
    "- **No correlation** is incorrect because the value is far from 0.  \n",

    "⬜ **(A) Pearson correlation coefficient**  \n",
    "✅ **(B) Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient**  \n",
    "⬜ **(C) Both can be used**  \n",
    "⬜ **(D) None of the above**  \n",
    "\n",
    "### **Explanation:**  \n",
    "Spearman’s rank correlation is preferred **when the relationship is not linear** because it measures **monotonic relationships** rather than strict linear relationships.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### **Reason for Incorrect Answers:**  \n",
    "- **Pearson correlation coefficient** assumes a **linear** relationship, so it may not be suitable.  \n",
    "- **Both can be used** is incorrect because Pearson’s may not give meaningful results in non-linear cases.  \n",
    "- **None of the above** is incorrect because Spearman’s correlation is appropriate.  \n",

    "### **8. A scientist is studying the relationship between the number of hours spent studying and the final exam scores of 50 students. He computes a Pearson correlation coefficient of -0.2. What does this result indicate?**  \n",
    "\n",
    "⬜ **(A) There is a strong negative correlation between the two variables**  \n",
    "✅ **(B) There is a weak negative correlation between the two variables**  \n",
    "⬜ **(C) There is no significant correlation between the two variables**  \n",
    "⬜ **(D) There is a weak positive correlation between the two variables**  \n",
    "\n",
    "### **Explanation:**  \n",
    "The **Pearson correlation coefficient ranges from -1 to 1**, where:  \n",
    "- **-1** indicates a perfect negative correlation,  \n",
    "- **0** indicates no correlation, and  \n",
    "- **1** indicates a perfect positive correlation.  \n",
    "\n",
    "A coefficient of **-0.2** indicates a **weak negative correlation**, meaning as the number of hours spent studying increases, final exam scores **tend to decrease slightly**, but the relationship is weak.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### **Reason for Incorrect Answers:**  \n",
    "- **Strong negative correlation** is incorrect because -0.2 is weak, not strong.  \n",
    "- **No significant correlation** is incorrect because there is still a weak relationship.  \n",
    "- **Weak positive correlation** is incorrect because the coefficient is negative.  \n",
