    "1. **What is the key difference between Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML)?**  \n",
    "\n",
    "   ⬜ AI is a subset of ML  \n",
    "   ✅ ML is a subset of AI  \n",
    "   ⬜ AI and ML are the same thing  \n",
    "   ⬜ AI and ML are completely unrelated  \n",
    "\n",
    "   **Explanation:** AI is the broad field of creating intelligent machines, while ML is one of the techniques used within AI to train machines to learn from data and make predictions.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Which type of learning requires labeled data for training?**  \n",
    "\n",
    "   ✅ Supervised Learning  \n",
    "   ⬜ Unsupervised Learning  \n",
    "   ⬜ Semi-Supervised Learning  \n",
    "   ⬜ Reinforcement Learning  \n",
    "\n",
    "   **Explanation:** In supervised learning, the machine is provided with labeled data during training to learn patterns and relationships between inputs and outputs.  \n",

    "3. **Which type of learning does not require labeled data for training?**  \n",
    "\n",
    "   ⬜ Supervised Learning  \n",
    "   ✅ Unsupervised Learning  \n",
    "   ⬜ Semi-Supervised Learning  \n",
    "   ⬜ Reinforcement Learning  \n",
    "\n",
    "   **Explanation:** In unsupervised learning, the machine is not provided with labeled data. Instead, it must find patterns and relationships within the data on its own.  \n",

    "4. **Which type of learning uses both labeled and unlabeled data for training?**  \n",
    "\n",
    "   ⬜ Supervised Learning  \n",
    "   ⬜ Unsupervised Learning  \n",
    "   ✅ Semi-Supervised Learning  \n",
    "   ⬜ Reinforcement Learning  \n",
    "\n",
    "   **Explanation:** In semi-supervised learning, a small amount of labeled data is used along with a large amount of unlabeled data to train the machine.  \n",

    "5. **What is the purpose of the validation set in machine learning?**  \n",
    "\n",
    "   ⬜ To train the machine learning model  \n",
    "   ⬜ To test the machine learning model  \n",
    "   ✅ To evaluate the machine learning model's performance during training  \n",
    "   ⬜ To evaluate the machine learning model's performance on new, unseen data  \n",
    "\n",
    "   **Explanation:** The validation set is used during the training process to evaluate the performance of the machine learning model on data that it has not seen before.  \n",

    "   ⬜ To validate the machine learning model  \n",
    "   ⬜ To evaluate the machine learning model's performance during training  \n",
    "   ✅ To evaluate the machine learning model's performance on new, unseen data  \n",
    "\n",
    "   **Explanation:** The test set is used after the machine learning model has been trained to evaluate its performance on data that it has never seen before, which is a critical step in determining the effectiveness of the model.  \n",
