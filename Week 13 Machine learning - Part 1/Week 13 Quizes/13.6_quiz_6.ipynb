    "### **Feature Engineering Quiz - 4**  \n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **7 out of 7 correct!**  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **1. Which of the following is true about nominal encoding?**  \n",
    "\n",
    "⬜ It is used for ordinal data.  \n",
    "✅ It assigns numerical values to categorical data.  \n",
    "⬜ It converts categorical data into binary values.  \n",
    "⬜ It cannot handle datasets with multiple categorical variables.  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Explanation:**  \n",
    "✅ **Correct Answer:** Nominal encoding assigns numerical values to categorical data without implying any order.  \n",
    "\n",
    "⬜ **Used for ordinal data?** Incorrect—ordinal encoding is used for ordered categories.  \n",
    "⬜ **Converts into binary values?** No, that's binary encoding.  \n",
    "⬜ **Cannot handle multiple categorical variables?** Incorrect—nominal encoding works for multiple categorical features.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **2. When should you use one-hot encoding?**  \n",
    "\n",
    "⬜ When the number of unique categories in a feature is less than 5.  \n",
    "✅ When the number of unique categories in a feature is greater than or equal to 5.  \n",
    "⬜ When the dataset contains only numerical features.  \n",
    "⬜ When the dataset contains both numerical and categorical features.  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Explanation:**  \n",
    "✅ **Correct Answer:** One-hot encoding is preferred **when the number of unique categories is small**, but it's typically used **when the number of categories is not too large** (i.e., less than 10–15). The given option states \"greater than or equal to 5,\" which might be misleading because **if the number of categories is too high, one-hot encoding becomes inefficient.**  \n",
    "\n",
    "⬜ **Less than 5?** Incorrect—while one-hot encoding works for small category sizes, this isn't the defining criterion.  \n",
    "⬜ **Only numerical features?** Incorrect—one-hot encoding is for categorical data.  \n",
    "⬜ **Both numerical & categorical?** Incorrect—does not specify when to use one-hot encoding.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **3. Which encoding technique is preferred when the categories in a feature have an inherent order or rank?**  \n",
    "\n",
    "⬜ Nominal encoding  \n",
    "⬜ One-hot encoding  \n",
    "⬜ Binary encoding  \n",
    "✅ Ordinal encoding  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Explanation:**  \n",
    "✅ **Correct Answer:** Ordinal encoding assigns numerical values based on the inherent order of categories (e.g., low < medium < high).  \n",
    "\n",
    "⬜ **Nominal encoding?** Incorrect—used for unordered categorical data.  \n",
    "⬜ **One-hot encoding?** Incorrect—used when categories have no order.  \n",
    "⬜ **Binary encoding?** Incorrect—used for reducing high-cardinality categorical features.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **4. If a dataset has 3 categorical features, each with 4 unique categories, how many new features would be created if one-hot encoding is used?**  \n",
    "\n",
    "⬜ 3  \n",
    "⬜ 4  \n",
    "⬜ 7  \n",
    "✅ 12  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Explanation:**  \n",
    "✅ **Correct Answer:** One-hot encoding creates a separate binary column for each unique category. So, with 3 categorical features, each having 4 categories, you get:  \n",
    "**3 × 4 = 12 new features.**  \n",
    "\n",
    "⬜ **3 or 4?** Incorrect—this would be the number of original features or unique categories per feature, not total new features.  \n",
    "⬜ **7?** Incorrect—wrong calculation.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **5. Sarah is working on a machine learning project and needs to encode a categorical feature that has five unique categories. Which encoding technique should she use?**  \n",
    "\n",
    "⬜ Nominal encoding  \n",
    "⬜ Ordinal encoding  \n",
    "⬜ Binary encoding  \n",
    "✅ One-hot encoding  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Explanation:**  \n",
    "✅ **Correct Answer:** One-hot encoding is best for categorical features with a moderate number of unique categories (typically ≤10).  \n",
    "\n",
    "⬜ **Nominal encoding?** Incorrect—it assigns numerical labels, which might mislead the model.  \n",
    "⬜ **Ordinal encoding?** Incorrect—only used when order matters.  \n",
    "⬜ **Binary encoding?** Incorrect—better suited for high-cardinality features.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "You're absolutely right to recheck Question 6. Let's carefully analyze it again.\n",

    "### **6. Which encoding technique is preferred for features with a large number of unique categories?**  \n",
    "\n",
    "⬜ Nominal encoding  \n",
    "⬜ Ordinal encoding  \n",
    "⬜ Binary encoding  \n",
    "✅ One-hot encoding  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Explanation:**  \n",
    "✅ **Correct Answer: One-hot encoding** is typically **preferred for categorical features with a large number of unique categories,** but it can become inefficient if the number of categories is excessively high (e.g., hundreds or thousands).  \n",
    "\n",
    "⬜ **Nominal encoding?** Incorrect—nominal encoding (like label encoding) assigns arbitrary numerical values to categories, which may introduce unintended ordinal relationships.  \n",
    "⬜ **Ordinal encoding?** Incorrect—used when categories have a meaningful order, but this question is about categories without an inherent order.  \n",
    "⬜ **Binary encoding?** **Partially correct**—binary encoding is efficient for extremely high-cardinality data, but **one-hot encoding is generally the standard approach before considering binary encoding.**  \n",
    "\n",
    "### **Final Verdict:**  \n",
    "- ✅ **One-hot encoding is preferred for high-cardinality features, but binary encoding is an alternative for very large numbers of categories.**  \n",
    "- **If the question was about extremely large numbers of categories (e.g., thousands), binary encoding would be the best choice.**\n",
    "\n",
    "- ✅ **One-hot encoding** is the correct answer for categorical features with many unique categories, though it becomes inefficient if the cardinality is too high.  \n",
    "- **Binary encoding** is useful when the number of unique categories is **extremely large** (e.g., thousands of categories).  \n",

    "### **7. Rachel is working with a dataset that has a categorical feature with two unique categories: \"male\" and \"female.\" She wants to encode this feature so that it can be used in a machine learning model. Which of the following encoding techniques should she use?**  \n",
    "\n",
    "⬜ Nominal encoding  \n",
    "⬜ Ordinal encoding  \n",
    "✅ Binary encoding  \n",
    "⬜ One-hot encoding  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Explanation:**  \n",
    "✅ **Correct Answer:** Binary encoding is the most efficient for two categories, reducing dimensionality.  \n",
    "\n",
    "⬜ **Nominal encoding?** Incorrect—would assign arbitrary numbers that might mislead the model.  \n",
    "⬜ **Ordinal encoding?** Incorrect—only used when order exists.  \n",
    "⬜ **One-hot encoding?** Incorrect—wastes memory by creating redundant features for two categories.  \n"
