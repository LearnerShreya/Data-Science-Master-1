    "✅ Label Encoding  \n",
    "⬜ Target Guided Ordinal Encoding  \n",
    "⬜ None of the above  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:**  \n",
    "✅ **Correct Answer: Label Encoding** is used for categorical variables **without inherent ordering,** assigning a unique integer to each category.  \n",
    "\n",
    "⬜ **Ordinal Encoding?** Incorrect—used when categories have a natural order.  \n",
    "⬜ **Target Guided Ordinal Encoding?** Incorrect—assigns values based on the target variable's mean.  \n",
