    "   ⬜ To perform feature extraction  \n",
    "\n",
    "   **Explanation:**  \n",
    "   - **Correct Answer:** Min-Max Scaling (Normalization) transforms data into a range of [0,1] by subtracting the minimum value and dividing by the range. This is useful for ensuring all features have equal importance in analysis.  \n",

    "   **Explanation:**  \n",
    "   - **Correct Answer:** Min-Max Scaling transforms values into a range of [0,1] by normalizing based on the min and max values.  \n",
    "   - **Incorrect Options:**  \n",
    "     - [-1,1] is typically used in standardization, not Min-Max Scaling.  \n",
    "     - [1,10] and [-10,10] are arbitrary and not used in Min-Max Scaling.  \n",
