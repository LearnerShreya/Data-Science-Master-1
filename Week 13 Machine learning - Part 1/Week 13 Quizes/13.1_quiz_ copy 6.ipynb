    "1. **Which of the following is a feature selection method that selects a subset of features based on their correlation with the target variable?**  \n",
    "\n",
    "   ✅ **Filter method**  \n",
    "   ⬜ Wrapper method  \n",
    "   ⬜ Embedded method  \n",
    "   ⬜ All of the above  \n",
    "\n",
    "   **Explanation:**  \n",
    "   - **Correct Answer:** The filter method ranks features based on statistical metrics like correlation, mutual information, or chi-square tests. It selects features independently of the model, making it computationally efficient.  \n",
    "   - **Incorrect Options:**  \n",
    "     - Wrapper method evaluates feature subsets based on model performance, not just correlation.  \n",
    "     - Embedded method integrates feature selection into the model training process, which is not solely based on correlation.  \n",
    "     - \"All of the above\" is incorrect because only the filter method focuses on correlation with the target variable.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Which of the following is a feature selection method that selects a subset of features based on their ability to improve the performance of a given model?**  \n",
    "\n",
    "   ⬜ Filter method  \n",
    "   ✅ **Wrapper method**  \n",
    "   ⬜ Embedded method  \n",
    "   ⬜ None of the above  \n",
    "\n",
    "   **Explanation:**  \n",
    "   - **Correct Answer:** The wrapper method evaluates feature subsets by training and testing the model on each subset. It selects features based on their impact on model performance.  \n",
    "   - **Incorrect Options:**  \n",
    "     - Filter method selects features based on statistical metrics, not model performance.  \n",
    "     - Embedded method combines feature selection with model training but does not explicitly evaluate subsets for performance improvement.  \n",
    "     - \"None of the above\" is incorrect because the wrapper method fits the description.  \n",

    "---\n",

    "3. **Which of the following is a feature selection method that combines feature selection with the model training process?**  \n",
    "\n",
    "   ⬜ Filter method  \n",
    "   ⬜ Wrapper method  \n",
    "   ✅ **Embedded method**  \n",
    "   ⬜ None of the above  \n",
    "\n",
    "   **Explanation:**  \n",
    "   - **Correct Answer:** The embedded method integrates feature selection into the model training process. Examples include Lasso regression (L1 regularization) and feature importance in decision trees.  \n",
    "   - **Incorrect Options:**  \n",
    "     - Filter method is independent of the model and does not combine feature selection with training.  \n",
    "     - Wrapper method evaluates subsets separately and does not integrate feature selection into training.  \n",
    "     - \"None of the above\" is incorrect because the embedded method fits the description.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Which of the following is a disadvantage of the filter method for feature selection?**  \n",
    "\n",
    "   ⬜ It is model-specific  \n",
    "   ⬜ It is computationally expensive  \n",
    "   ✅ **It does not consider the interactions between features**  \n",
    "   ⬜ It is not based on a statistical metric  \n",
    "\n",
    "   **Explanation:**  \n",
    "   - **Correct Answer:** The filter method evaluates features individually, ignoring interactions between them. This can lead to selecting redundant or suboptimal features.  \n",
    "   - **Incorrect Options:**  \n",
    "     - Filter method is not model-specific; it is independent of the model.  \n",
    "     - Filter method is computationally efficient, not expensive.  \n",
    "     - Filter method is based on statistical metrics, so this option is incorrect.  \n",

    "5. **Which of the following is an advantage of the wrapper method for feature selection?**  \n",
    "\n",
    "   ⬜ It is computationally efficient  \n",
    "   ⬜ It is independent of the model used  \n",
    "   ✅ **It considers the interactions between features**  \n",
    "   ⬜ It is based on a statistical metric  \n",
    "\n",
    "   **Explanation:**  \n",
    "   - **Correct Answer:** The wrapper method evaluates feature subsets by considering their combined impact on model performance, capturing interactions between features.  \n",
    "   - **Incorrect Options:**  \n",
    "     - Wrapper method is computationally expensive, not efficient.  \n",
    "     - Wrapper method is model-dependent, not independent.  \n",
    "     - Wrapper method is not based on statistical metrics; it relies on model performance.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **What is the primary difference between the filter method and the wrapper method for feature selection?**  \n",
    "\n",
    "   ⬜ The filter method is model-specific, while the wrapper method is independent of the model used.  \n",
    "   ✅ **The filter method selects features based on their correlation with the target variable, while the wrapper method evaluates subsets of features based on their ability to improve model performance.**  \n",
    "   ⬜ The filter method considers the interactions between features, while the wrapper method does not.  \n",
    "   ⬜ The filter method combines feature selection with the model training process, while the wrapper method does not.  \n",
    "\n",
    "   **Explanation:**  \n",
    "   - **Correct Answer:** The filter method uses statistical metrics (e.g., correlation) to rank features, while the wrapper method evaluates subsets based on their impact on model performance.  \n",
    "   - **Incorrect Options:**  \n",
    "     - Filter method is model-agnostic, while the wrapper method is model-specific.  \n",
    "     - Filter method does not consider feature interactions, while the wrapper method does.  \n",
    "     - Embedded method, not the filter method, combines feature selection with model training.  \n"
