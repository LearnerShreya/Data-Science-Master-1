    "### 1. What does the lambda function in Python do?\n",
    "\n",
    "- [ ] creates an infinite loop  \n",
    "- [ ] creates a named function  \n",
    "- [x] creates an anonymous function  \n",
    "- [ ] None of the above  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:**  \n",
    "A lambda function is an anonymous function in Python, meaning that it is a small, one-line function that doesn't have a name. They are used to create small, throw-away functions that are used for a limited time.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. What does the map function in Python do?\n",
    "\n",
    "- [ ] returns the first element in a list  \n",
    "- [x] applies a function to each element in a list and returns a list of the results  \n",
    "- [ ] returns the last element in a list  \n",
    "- [ ] None of the above  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:**  \n",
    "The `map` function in Python takes a function and an iterable as arguments and returns a new iterable with the function applied to each element. The result is a list of the results, which can be used for further processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. What does the reduce function in Python do?\n",
    "\n",
    "- [ ] applies a function to each element in a list and returns a list of the results  \n",
    "- [x] applies a function cumulatively to elements of an iterable, from left to right  \n",
    "- [ ] returns the first element in a list  \n",
    "- [ ] None of the above  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:**  \n",
    "The `reduce` function in Python takes a function and an iterable as arguments and applies the function cumulatively to the elements of the iterable. The result is a single value, which is the final result of the reduction.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. What does the filter function in Python do?\n",
    "\n",
    "- [x] returns a filtered list of elements that satisfy a condition  \n",
    "- [ ] returns the first element in a list  \n",
    "- [ ] returns the last element in a list  \n",
    "- [ ] None of the above  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:**  \n",
    "The `filter` function in Python takes a function and an iterable as arguments and returns a new iterable with only the elements that satisfy the condition specified by the function. The result is a filtered list of elements that satisfy the condition.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. What is the output of the following code?\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n",
    "squared_numbers = map(lambda x: x**2, numbers)\n",
    "print(list(squared_numbers))\n"

    "- [ ] [0, 1, 4, 9, 16]  \n",
    "- [ ] [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]  \n",
    "- [x] [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]  \n",
    "- [ ] None of the above  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:**  \n",
    "In this code, the `map` function is applied to each element in the list `numbers` using the lambda function, which squares each element. The result is a list of squared numbers, which is `[1, 4, 9, 16, 25]`.\n",

    "### 6. What is the output of the following code?\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from functools import reduce\n",
    "numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n",
    "product = reduce(lambda x, y: x*y, numbers)\n",
    "print(product)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- [x] 120  \n",
    "- [ ] 30  \n",
    "- [ ] 15  \n",
    "- [ ] None of the above  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:**  \n",
    "In this code, the `reduce` function is applied to the list `numbers` using the lambda function, which multiplies two elements. The result is the product of all elements in the list, which is `120`.\n",
