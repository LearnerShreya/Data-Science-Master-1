    "### 1. What is the purpose of a function in Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "- [x] To break up a program into smaller, reusable pieces of code  ✔️\n",
    "- [ ] To store data in memory  \n",
    "- [x] To perform a specific task or set of tasks  \n",
    "- [ ] To control the flow of a program  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:**  \n",
    "Functions allow you to break up a program into smaller, more manageable pieces of code. Functions can be defined once and then called multiple times from different parts of a program, reducing the need for duplicate code and making it easier to maintain and modify your code.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. What is the syntax for defining a function in Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "- [ ] define function_name(arguments):  \n",
    "- [ ] function function_name(arguments):  \n",
    "- [x] def function_name(arguments)  ✔️\n",
    "- [ ] create function_name(arguments):  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:**  \n",
    "The syntax for defining a function in Python is `def function_name(arguments):`. The `def` keyword is used to declare a function, followed by the function name and any arguments in parentheses. The code in the function is indented and is executed when the function is called.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. What is parameter passing in Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "- [x] The process of sending data to a function as input  ✔️\n",
    "- [ ] The process of storing data in memory  \n",
    "- [ ] The process of returning data from a function  \n",
    "- [ ] The process of manipulating data in a function  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:**  \n",
    "Parameter passing refers to the process of sending data to a function as input. The function can then perform some operation on the data and return a result. The data can be passed as positional arguments, keyword arguments, or a combination of both.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. What is the purpose of iterators in Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "- [ ] To repeat a block of code a specified number of times  \n",
    "- [x] To allow for efficient access to elements in a sequence one at a time  ✔️\n",
    "- [ ] To store data in memory  \n",
    "- [ ] To manipulate data in a function  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:**  \n",
    "Iterators in Python allow for efficient access to elements in a sequence one at a time. This allows for the creation of efficient and memory-saving loops that can process large amounts of data. Examples of sequences in Python include lists, tuples, and dictionaries.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. What is a generator function in Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "- [x] A function that generates a sequence of values  ✔️\n",
    "- [x] A function that creates an iterator  \n",
    "- [ ] A function that performs a specific task or set of tasks  \n",
    "- [ ] A function that breaks up a program into smaller, reusable pieces of code  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:**  \n",
    "A generator function in Python is a special type of function that generates a sequence of values. When called, it returns an iterator that can be used to iterate over the values in the sequence. Generator functions use the `yield` statement to return values one at a time, allowing for efficient and memory-saving processing of large amounts of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. What is the difference between a normal function and a generator function in Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "- [x] Normal functions return a single value, while generator functions return an iterator  \n",
    "- [x] Normal functions use the `return` statement, while generator functions use the `yield` statement  ✔️\n",
    "- [ ] Normal functions can only be used once, while generator functions can be used multiple times  \n",
    "- [ ] Normal functions can only return numbers, while generator functions can return any type of data  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:**  \n",
    "Normal functions return a single value using the `return` statement, while generator functions return an iterator and use the `yield` statement to return values one at a time. This makes generator functions more memory-efficient, especially when dealing with large datasets.\n"
