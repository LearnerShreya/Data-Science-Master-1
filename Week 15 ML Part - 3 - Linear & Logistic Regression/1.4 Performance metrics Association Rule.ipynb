    "## 🔰 **1. Introduction to Association Rule Mining**\n",
    "\n",
    "Association Rule Mining is a technique used to identify relationships or patterns among a set of items in **transaction databases**, relational databases, or other data repositories.  \n",
    "It’s mainly used in **market basket analysis**, where we analyze which items are frequently bought together.\n",
    "\n",
    "A typical **association rule** has the form:\n",
    "\n",
    "> **X ⇒ Y**  \n",
    "> (meaning: *If itemset X is bought, itemset Y is also likely to be bought*)\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "- **X** = Antecedent (Left-hand side, condition)\n",
    "- **Y** = Consequent (Right-hand side, result)\n",

    "| **Itemset**  | A group/set of items (e.g., {bread, butter}) |\n",
    "| **Transaction** | A record of items bought together (e.g., in a receipt) |\n",

    "\n",
    "The quality of an association rule is measured using the following metrics:\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔹 3.1 **Support**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Definition**:  \n",
    "Support indicates how frequently an itemset appears in the entire dataset. It helps to filter out infrequent itemsets.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Formula**:  \n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{Support}(X ⇒ Y) = \\frac{\\text{Number of transactions containing both } X \\text{ and } Y}{\\text{Total number of transactions}} = P(X ∪ Y)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Purpose**:\n",
    "- Measures the **popularity** of an itemset.\n",
    "- Helps in finding relevant rules that occur frequently.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**:\n",
    "- Out of 100 transactions, 20 contain both milk and bread.  \n",
    "- Support = $20 / 100 = \\mathbf{0.20}$ (or 20%)\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔹 3.2 **Confidence**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Definition**:  \n",
    "Confidence is the likelihood that item Y is also purchased when item X is purchased.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Formula**:  \n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{Confidence}(X ⇒ Y) = \\frac{\\text{Support}(X ∪ Y)}{\\text{Support}(X)} = P(Y|X)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Purpose**:\n",
    "- Measures **accuracy** of the rule.\n",
    "- Reflects **how often** the rule has been found true.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**:\n",
    "- 40 people buy milk, and 20 buy both milk and bread.  \n",
    "- Confidence = $20 / 40 = \\mathbf{0.50}$ (or 50%)\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔹 3.3 **Lift**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Definition**:  \n",
    "Lift shows how much more likely Y is to occur with X than by random chance.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Formula**:  \n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{Lift}(X ⇒ Y) = \\frac{\\text{Confidence}(X ⇒ Y)}{\\text{Support}(Y)} = \\frac{P(Y|X)}{P(Y)}\n",

    "**Purpose**:\n",
    "- Measures **correlation** between X and Y.\n",
    "- Shows how much more likely Y is purchased when X is purchased, compared to random probability.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Interpretation**:\n",
    "- **Lift > 1**: Positive correlation  \n",
    "- **Lift = 1**: No correlation  \n",
    "- **Lift < 1**: Negative correlation\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**:\n",
    "- Confidence = 0.50, Support of Bread = 0.30  \n",
    "- Lift = $0.50 / 0.30 = \\mathbf{1.67}$\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔹 3.4 **Leverage**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Definition**:  \n",
    "Leverage measures the difference between the observed frequency of X and Y occurring together and the expected frequency if they were independent.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Formula**:  \n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{Leverage}(X ⇒ Y) = \\text{Support}(X ∪ Y) - (\\text{Support}(X) \\times \\text{Support}(Y))\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Purpose**:\n",
    "- Measures the **statistical dependence** of X and Y.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**:\n",
    "- Support(X ∪ Y) = 0.20  \n",
    "- Support(X) = 0.40, Support(Y) = 0.30  \n",
    "- Leverage = $0.20 - (0.4 × 0.3) = \\mathbf{0.08}$\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔹 3.5 **Conviction**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Definition**:  \n",
    "Conviction evaluates how often X appears **without** Y and compares this with the expected frequency of X appearing without Y.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Formula**:  \n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{Conviction}(X ⇒ Y) = \\frac{1 - \\text{Support}(Y)}{1 - \\text{Confidence}(X ⇒ Y)}\n",
    "$$\n",

    "- Measures the **strength and direction** of implication.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Interpretation**:\n",
    "- Conviction = 1 → Rule has no effect  \n",
