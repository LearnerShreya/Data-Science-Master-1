    "**What is Lasso Regression?**\n",
    "\n",
    "- ✅ **A linear regression model that uses regularization**  \n",
    "- A non-linear regression model  \n",
    "- A model that fits a polynomial curve to the data  \n",
    "- A model that uses decision trees to predict outcomes  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:** Lasso (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator) is a linear regression method that includes L1 regularization to prevent overfitting.\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.  \n",
    "**What is the purpose of Lasso Regression?**\n",
    "\n",
    "- To maximize the R-squared value of the model  \n",
    "- To minimize the mean squared error of the model  \n",
    "- ✅ **To prevent overfitting in the model**  \n",
    "- To fit a polynomial curve to the data  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:** Lasso helps avoid overfitting by penalizing large coefficients, pushing some to exactly zero—performing feature selection.\n",

    "### 3.  \n",
    "**Which of the following is a hyperparameter of Lasso Regression?**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Learning rate  \n",
    "- ✅ **Regularization parameter**  \n",
    "- Number of iterations  \n",
    "- Number of hidden layers  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:** The regularization parameter (often denoted by \\( \\lambda \\)) controls how strongly the penalty term is applied in the Lasso cost function.\n",

    "\n",
    "### 4.  \n",
    "**Which of the following is an advantage of Lasso Regression?**\n",
    "\n",
    "- It can handle non-linear relationships between features and the target variable  \n",
    "- It can handle missing values in the data  \n",
    "- ✅ **It can select the most important features in the model**  \n",
    "- It is computationally less expensive than other regression models  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:** Lasso automatically performs feature selection by driving less important feature coefficients to zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5.  \n",
    "**Which of the following is a disadvantage of Lasso Regression?**\n",
    "\n",
    "- It can only be used for linear regression problems  \n",
    "- ✅ **It is sensitive to the scale of the features**  \n",
    "- It is prone to underfitting  \n",
    "- It can handle missing values in the data  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:** Since Lasso penalizes based on the absolute magnitude of coefficients, scaling is essential for proper performance.\n",

    "\n",
    "### 6.  \n",
    "**Which of the following is the penalty term used in Lasso Regression?**\n",
    "\n",
    "- ✅ **L1 norm of the model coefficients**  \n",
    "- L2 norm of the model coefficients  \n",
    "- Absolute difference between the predicted and actual values  \n",
    "- Square of the difference between the predicted and actual values  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:** The L1 norm adds the absolute values of the coefficients, promoting sparsity (i.e., zero coefficients for some features).\n"
