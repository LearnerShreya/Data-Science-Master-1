    "**What is the purpose of Ridge Regression?**\n",
    "\n",
    "- To minimize the sum of squared residuals  \n",
    "- ✅ **To eliminate multicollinearity in the dataset**  \n",
    "- To identify the most important predictors  \n",
    "- To maximize the accuracy of the model  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:** Ridge Regression helps deal with multicollinearity by shrinking coefficients, improving model stability and generalization.\n",

    "\n",
    "### 2.  \n",
    "**How does Ridge Regression differ from ordinary least squares (OLS) regression?**\n",
    "\n",
    "- ✅ **Ridge Regression adds a penalty term to the cost function**  \n",
    "- OLS regression uses a regularization technique  \n",
    "- Ridge Regression does not account for multicollinearity  \n",
    "- OLS regression shrinks coefficients towards zero  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:** Ridge adds an L2 regularization term to penalize large coefficients, while OLS doesn't regularize.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.  \n",
    "**In Ridge Regression, what is the value of the penalty term lambda (λ) used for?**\n",
    "\n",
    "- To increase the accuracy of the model  \n",
    "- To decrease the complexity of the model  \n",
    "- ✅ **To control the amount of shrinkage applied to the coefficients**  \n",
    "- To select the most important predictors  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:** Lambda (λ) controls the strength of the penalty—higher λ means more shrinkage of coefficients.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.  \n",
    "**What is the main advantage of Ridge Regression?**\n",
    "\n",
    "- It reduces the complexity of the model  \n",
    "- ✅ **It eliminates multicollinearity in the dataset**  \n",
    "- It selects the most important predictors  \n",
    "- It increases the accuracy of the model  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:** By penalizing large coefficients, Ridge Regression stabilizes the model when predictors are correlated.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5.  \n",
    "**How does Ridge Regression affect the coefficients of the predictors in the dataset?**\n",
    "\n",
    "- It increases the magnitude of the coefficients  \n",
    "- ✅ **It decreases the magnitude of the coefficients**  \n",
    "- It does not affect the magnitude of the coefficients  \n",
    "- It sets the coefficients to zero  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:** Ridge shrinks coefficients **towards** zero, but not **exactly to** zero like Lasso, reducing overfitting.\n"
