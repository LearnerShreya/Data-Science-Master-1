    "### **Logistic Regression** - In-Depth Notes\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **1. Introduction:**\n",
    "Logistic Regression is a statistical method commonly used for **classification tasks**. While traditionally used for **binary classification** (two classes), it can be extended for **multiclass** (more than two classes) and **ordinal classification**. Despite its name, logistic regression is not a regression algorithm but a classification algorithm. It is popular due to its simplicity, interpretability, and efficiency.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **2. Basic Concept:**\n",
    "Logistic regression's main goal is to model the probability of a certain class. Given input features, it predicts the likelihood of an instance belonging to a specific class. The result is a probability, which is then used to classify the instance as belonging to one class or another.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **3. Logistic Function (Sigmoid Function):**\n",
    "The core of logistic regression is the **sigmoid function**, which maps any real-valued input to a value between 0 and 1, making it interpretable as a probability.\n",
    "\n",
    "The formula for the sigmoid function is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\hat{y} = \\frac{1}{1 + e^{-z}} \\quad \\text{where} \\quad z = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_1 + \\dots + \\beta_n x_n\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "- $\\hat{y}$ is the predicted probability of the positive class (class = 1).\n",
    "- $z$ is the linear combination of the input features $x_1, x_2, \\dots, x_n$ weighted by the coefficients $\\beta_1, \\beta_2, \\dots, \\beta_n$, and $\\beta_0$ is the intercept.\n",
    "- The output $\\hat{y}$ lies between 0 and 1 and represents the probability of the positive class.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **4. Interpretation of Output:**\n",
    "The output of logistic regression, $\\hat{y}$, represents the probability of an instance belonging to the positive class. Based on this probability, the model classifies the instance:\n",
    "- If $\\hat{y} \\geq 0.5$, classify the instance as the positive class (class = 1).\n",
    "- If $\\hat{y} < 0.5$, classify the instance as the negative class (class = 0).\n",
    "\n",
    "This threshold can be adjusted according to the specific problem or application.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **5. Cost Function (Log-Loss):**\n",
    "The logistic regression model is trained by minimizing the **logarithmic loss** or **log-loss** (also known as **cross-entropy**). The objective is to find the model parameters $\\beta$ that minimize this loss function.\n",
    "\n",
    "For binary classification, the log-loss function is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "J(\\beta) = -\\frac{1}{m} \\sum_{i=1}^{m} \\left[y^{(i)} \\log(\\hat{y}^{(i)}) + (1 - y^{(i)}) \\log(1 - \\hat{y}^{(i)})\\right]\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "- $m$ is the number of training examples.\n",
    "- $y^{(i)}$ is the actual label for the $i$-th example (0 or 1).\n",
    "- $\\hat{y}^{(i)}$ is the predicted probability of the $i$-th example belonging to the positive class.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **6. Model Training:**\n",
    "Logistic regression is trained using optimization techniques such as **Gradient Descent** or **Newton's Method**. The goal is to find the parameters $\\beta$ that minimize the cost function, thereby improving the model's accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **7. Types of Logistic Regression:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Binary Logistic Regression:**\n",
    "   - Used for **binary classification** tasks where the target variable has two possible outcomes (0 or 1, True or False).\n",
    "   - **Example Use Cases**: Spam detection (Spam or Not Spam), Disease diagnosis (e.g., Cancer or No Cancer), Customer churn prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Multinomial (Multiclass) Logistic Regression:**\n",
    "   - A generalized form of logistic regression for **multiclass classification**. The problem is decomposed into multiple binary classification tasks using the **one-vs-rest** technique.\n",
    "   - **Example Use Cases**: Handwritten digit recognition (0-9), Classifying types of flowers (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica), Predicting customer choices from multiple options.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Ordinal Logistic Regression:**\n",
    "   - Used for **ordinal classification**, where the target variable has categories with a **meaningful order**, but no fixed interval between categories.\n",
    "   - **Example Use Cases**: Rating systems (Poor, Average, Good), Education levels (High School, Bachelor's, Master's), Customer satisfaction (Unsatisfied, Neutral, Satisfied).\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Nominal Logistic Regression (Multinomial Logistic Regression for Nominal Categories):**\n",
    "   - Used when the target variable consists of **nominal categories**. Nominal categories are distinct, non-ordered classes with no inherent ranking.\n",
    "   - **Example Use Cases**: Color classification (Red, Green, Blue), Brand preference (Nike, Adidas, Puma), Geographic regions (North, South, East, West).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **8. Advantages of Logistic Regression:**\n",
    "1. **Simple and Interpretable**: The model is straightforward and provides interpretable results as probabilities.\n",
    "2. **Computationally Efficient**: It is a lightweight algorithm that can handle large datasets effectively.\n",
    "3. **Probabilistic Output**: The model outputs probabilities, which can be used for decision-making (e.g., determining the likelihood of an event).\n",
    "4. **Works Well for Linearly Separable Data**: Logistic regression is most effective when the data is linearly separable (or can be transformed to be separable in the log-odds space).\n",
    "5. **Flexible**: It can be applied to binary, multiclass, and ordinal classification tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **9. Limitations of Logistic Regression:**\n",
    "1. **Linear Decision Boundaries**: Logistic regression assumes a linear relationship between the input variables and the log-odds of the outcome, which can be a limitation for complex, non-linear problems.\n",
    "2. **Sensitive to Outliers**: Logistic regression can be influenced by outliers, leading to overfitting.\n",
    "3. **No Complex Feature Interactions**: The model does not inherently capture interactions between features unless manually included.\n",
    "4. **Requires Feature Engineering**: In cases of non-linear relationships, feature transformations (like polynomial features) may be necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **10. Evaluation Metrics:**\n",
    "1. **Accuracy**: The proportion of correct predictions to the total number of predictions.\n",
    "2. **Precision**: The proportion of positive predictions that are actually correct.\n",
    "3. **Recall (Sensitivity)**: The proportion of actual positives that are correctly identified by the model.\n",
    "4. **F1-Score**: The harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a balanced measure.\n",
    "5. **Confusion Matrix**: A matrix that provides a detailed breakdown of the model’s performance, showing true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **11. Regularization in Logistic Regression:**\n",
    "Regularization techniques like **L1 (Lasso)** and **L2 (Ridge)** are used to prevent **overfitting**, especially when working with high-dimensional data. Regularization adds a penalty to the cost function to constrain the model’s coefficients.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **L1 Regularization (Lasso)**: Encourages sparsity, forcing some coefficients to zero, which can be useful for feature selection.\n",
    "- **L2 Regularization (Ridge)**: Penalizes large coefficients but does not force them to zero, which can help prevent overfitting without eliminating features.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **13. Comparison of Logistic Regression Types:**\n",

    "## 🔷 Multiclass Classification using Logistic Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "### ✳️ What is Multiclass Classification?\n",
    "Multiclass classification is a type of classification where **the output variable has more than two categories** or classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "📌 **Example**:  \n",
    "- Classifying animals into: `Dog`, `Cat`, `Horse`  \n",
    "- Predicting the digit from an image: `0` to `9`\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔷 Logistic Regression: A Quick Recap\n",
    "Logistic Regression is originally used for **binary classification**:\n",
    "- Output: 0 or 1  \n",
    "- Uses **Sigmoid Function** to map predictions to probabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔷 Extending Logistic Regression to Multiclass\n",
    "\n",
    "Since logistic regression is designed for binary outputs, we need strategies to handle **multiple classes**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## ✅ Two Main Approaches\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **One-vs-Rest (OvR)** — also called **One-vs-All (OvA)**\n",
    "- For `K` classes, **K binary classifiers** are trained.\n",
    "- Each classifier separates **one class** from the **rest**.\n",
    "- At prediction time: the class with the **highest probability** is chosen.\n",
    "\n",
    "📌 **Example**:  \n",
    "For 3 classes: `A`, `B`, `C`, you'll train:  \n",
    "- Classifier 1: `A` vs `not A`  \n",
    "- Classifier 2: `B` vs `not B`  \n",
    "- Classifier 3: `C` vs `not C`  \n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Multinomial Logistic Regression (Softmax Regression)**\n",
    "- All classes are predicted **together** using a **single model**.\n",
    "- Uses **Softmax Function** instead of Sigmoid.\n",
    "- Outputs **probabilities** for each class.\n",
    "- The class with the **highest probability** is selected.\n",

    "- $ K $ is the total number of classes  \n",
    "- Output: vector of probabilities that sum to 1\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔶 Cross-Entropy Loss (used in Multiclass)\n",

    "$$\n",
    "\\text{Loss} = - \\sum_{k=1}^{K} y_k \\log(P(y=k|x))\n",
    "$$\n",
    "Where:  \n",
    "- $ y_k $ is 1 if the class is correct, 0 otherwise  \n",
    "- $ P(y=k|x) $ is the predicted probability for class k\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",

    "$$\n",
    "z_k = W_k^T x + b_k\n",
    "$$\n",
    "Then apply Softmax on all $ z_k $ to get class probabilities.\n",

    "### 2. **Loss Function**:\n",
    "Use **categorical cross-entropy** to measure error.\n",
