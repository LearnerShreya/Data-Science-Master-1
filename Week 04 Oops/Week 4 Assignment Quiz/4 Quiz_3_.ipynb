    "## Question 1:  \n",
    "**Refer to the below code:**  \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Human:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, first_name, last_name, age):\n",
    "        self.first_name = first_name\n",
    "        self.last_name = last_name\n",
    "        self.age = age\n",
    "\n",
    "h001 = Human(\"Abhay\", \"Kashyap\", 26)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**In the above code, which will act as the object?**  \n",
    "- A) Human  \n",
    "- B) h001  \n",
    "- C) Abhay  \n",
    "- D) \"Abhay\"  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Correct Answer:** B) h001\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:** Here, the Human is a class that gives the blueprint to construct the object. When the class with corresponding properties are passed into the h001 variable then the variable h001 will act as an object.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:** In the code, `Human` is a class that serves as a blueprint to create objects. When we create an instance of the class and assign it to the variable `h001`, this variable acts as the object.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 2:  \n",
    "**In the above code, self is a ____ .**  \n",
    "- A) Keyword  \n",
    "- B) Attribute  \n",
    "- C) Constructor  \n",
    "- D) Reference to the current instance of the class  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Correct Answer:** D) Reference to the current instance of the class\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:** The self parameter is a reference to the current instance of the class, and is used to access variables that belong to the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:** The `self` parameter is a reference to the current instance of the class. It is used to access attributes and methods that belong to the class instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 3:  \n",
    "**Maximum how many objects can be created using a class?**  \n",
    "- A) Only 2  \n",
    "- B) 1  \n",
    "- C) Depends on the number of attributes in it  \n",
    "- D) Multiple  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Correct Answer:** D) Multiple\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:** The class is just a blueprint to create an object so there is no limit in creating objects using a single class. Thus, we can create multiple objects using a single class.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:** A class is just a blueprint for creating objects, and there is no limit to the number of objects that can be created from a single class.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 4:  \n",
    "**From the above code, which one is the constructor?**  \n",
    "- A) class  \n",
    "- B) def  \n",
    "- C) __init__  \n",
    "- D) Human  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Correct Answer:** C) __init__\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:** The class is just a blueprint to create an object so there is no limit in creating objects using a single class. Thus, we can create multiple objects using a single class.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:** A constructor is a special method in Python used to initialize the attributes of a class when an object is created. In this case, `__init__` is the constructor that assigns values to the class attributes.\n",
