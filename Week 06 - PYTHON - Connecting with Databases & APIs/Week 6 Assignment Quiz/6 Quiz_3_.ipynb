    "## 1. What is a Web API?\n",
    "- [x] **A set of standards and protocols for accessing web-based software applications or web tools**\n",
    "- [ ] A software framework for building web applications  \n",
    "- [ ] A web page design tool  \n",
    "- [ ] None of the above  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:**  \n",
    "A Web API is a set of standards and protocols for accessing web-based software applications or tools. It allows different software systems to communicate over the internet.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. What is the primary purpose of a Web API?\n",
    "- [ ] To create web pages  \n",
    "- [x] **To access and retrieve data from a remote server**  \n",
    "- [ ] To provide a user interface for web-based applications  \n",
    "- [ ] None of the above  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:**  \n",
    "The primary purpose of a Web API is to allow systems to access and retrieve data from a remote server, enabling interconnected systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. What is an API endpoint?\n",
    "- [ ] A server that hosts an API  \n",
    "- [x] **A unique address that specifies the location of a server's API**  \n",
    "- [ ] A graphical representation of API data  \n",
    "- [ ] None of the above  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:**  \n",
    "An API endpoint is the unique address where an API can be accessed, specifying the type of request (e.g., GET or POST).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. What is a REST API?\n",
    "- [x] **A type of API that uses Representational State Transfer (REST) principles**  \n",
    "- [ ] A software tool for testing API functionality  \n",
    "- [ ] A programming language used for creating APIs  \n",
    "- [ ] All of the above  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:**  \n",
    "REST APIs use REST principles to design lightweight, scalable web services that utilize standard HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5. What is an API?\n",
    "- [x] **An Application Programming Interface that allows software applications to interact with each other.**  \n",
    "- [ ] A Web-based Application Programming Interface that allows software applications to interact over the internet.  \n",
    "- [ ] A software platform that provides a graphical user interface.  \n",
    "- [ ] All of the above  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:**  \n",
    "APIs enable software applications to interact by sharing data and functionality, acting as a mediator.\n",

    "\n",
    "## 6. What are some common uses of Web APIs?\n",
    "- [ ] Accessing databases and servers.  \n",
    "- [ ] Integrating third-party services and data into applications.  \n",
    "- [ ] Allowing applications to communicate with each other.  \n",
    "- [x] **Both A and B**  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:**  \n",
    "Web APIs allow accessing databases, integrating third-party services, and facilitating communication between software systems.\n",

    "## 7. What is REST?\n",
    "- [x] **A software architecture style for creating scalable web services.**  \n",
    "- [ ] A protocol for sending and receiving messages between applications.  \n",
    "- [ ] A database management system.  \n",
    "- [ ] None of the above  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:**  \n",
    "REST (Representational State Transfer) is a lightweight software architecture style for scalable web services using HTTP and returning JSON or XML.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 8. What is SOAP?\n",
    "- [ ] A software architecture style for creating scalable web services.  \n",
    "- [x] **A protocol for sending and receiving messages between applications.**  \n",
    "- [ ] A database management system.  \n",
    "- [ ] All of the above  \n",
