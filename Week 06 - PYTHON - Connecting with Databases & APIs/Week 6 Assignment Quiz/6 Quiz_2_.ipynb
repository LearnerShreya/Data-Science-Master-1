    "- [ ] MongoDB-Py  \n",
    "- [x] PyMongo  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation**: PyMongo is the official MongoDB driver for Python. It is a Python library that allows you to interact with MongoDB from Python, providing a simple way to connect, query data, and perform CRUD operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. How do you connect to MongoDB using PyMongo in Python?  \n",
    "- [ ] By using the `connect()` method  \n",
    "- [ ] By using the `PyMongo()` method  \n",
    "- [x] By using the `MongoClient()` method  \n",
    "- [ ] By using the `MongoDB()` method  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation**: To connect to MongoDB using PyMongo in Python, you use the `MongoClient()` method. It takes a connection string as an argument to specify the host and port of the MongoDB server.\n",

    "- [ ] By using the `get_collection()` method  \n",
    "- [ ] By using the `get_database()` method  \n",
    "- [x] By using the `database[collection]` syntax  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation**: To access a collection in MongoDB using PyMongo, you use the `database[collection]` syntax. This allows you to perform CRUD operations on the collection.\n",

    "- [ ] By using the `insert()` method  \n",
    "- [ ] By using the `save()` method  \n",
    "- [ ] By using the `add()` method  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation**: The `insert_one()` method is used to insert a document into a collection in MongoDB. It takes a document as an argument and returns an `InsertOneResult` object.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. How do you query documents from a collection in MongoDB using PyMongo in Python?  \n",
    "- [x] By using the `find()` method  \n",
    "- [ ] By using the `query()` method  \n",
    "- [ ] By using the `get()` method  \n",
    "- [ ] By using the `select()` method  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation**: The `find()` method is used to query documents from a collection. It returns a cursor to iterate over the matching documents.\n",

    "### 6. What is MongoDB?  \n",
    "- [ ] A relational database management system  \n",
    "- [x] A document-oriented database management system  \n",
    "- [ ] A graph database management system  \n",
    "- [ ] A key-value store database management system  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation**: MongoDB is a document-oriented database management system that stores data as documents in BSON (Binary JSON). It supports rich data types like arrays and nested structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7. What is a collection in MongoDB?  \n",
    "- [ ] A database  \n",
    "- [ ] A table  \n",
    "- [x] A set of documents  \n",
    "- [ ] A set of rows  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation**: A collection in MongoDB is a set of documents. It is equivalent to a table in relational databases but offers a more flexible data model.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 8. What is a document in MongoDB?  \n",
    "- [ ] A row  \n",
