    "### **REST (Representational State Transfer) Architecture**\n",
    "\n",
    "REST is an architectural style used for building distributed systems, particularly web services, that emphasize simplicity and scalability.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Key Principles of REST**:\n",
    "1. **Stateless**: \n",
    "   - Each client request must contain all necessary information.\n",
    "   - The server does not store session details.\n",
    "2. **Resource-Based**:\n",
    "   - Everything is treated as a resource (e.g., user, order).\n",
    "   - Resources are identified using URIs (e.g., `/users/123`).\n",
    "3. **Standard HTTP Methods**:\n",
    "   - **GET**: Retrieve data.\n",
    "   - **POST**: Create new data.\n",
    "   - **PUT**: Update existing data.\n",
    "   - **DELETE**: Remove data.\n",
    "4. **Representations**:\n",
    "   - Resources can be represented in various formats (JSON, XML, HTML).\n",
    "5. **Cacheability**:\n",
    "   - Responses indicate whether they are cacheable or not for efficiency.\n",
    "6. **Layered System**:\n",
    "   - Communication can involve intermediaries like load balancers or caches, but the client remains unaware.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Advantages of REST**:\n",
    "- Simple and lightweight.\n",
    "- Better performance due to statelessness.\n",
    "- Easy integration with web technologies.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **REST Example**:\n",
    "**Request**:\n",
    "```\n",
    "GET /api/v1/users/123 HTTP/1.1\n",
    "Host: example.com\n",
    "```\n",
    "**Response**:\n",
    "```json\n",
    "{\n",
    "  \"id\": 123,\n",
    "  \"name\": \"Shreya Singh\",\n",
    "  \"email\": \"shreya@example.com\"\n",

    "### **SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) Architecture**\n",
    "\n",
    "SOAP is a protocol designed for exchanging structured information in web services. It is often used in enterprise applications requiring high security and standardization.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Key Components of SOAP**:\n",
    "1. **SOAP Envelope**:\n",
    "   - Encapsulates the message and defines its structure.\n",
    "2. **SOAP Header**:\n",
    "   - Optional metadata (e.g., authentication, session details).\n",
    "3. **SOAP Body**:\n",
    "   - Contains the actual message or request/response data.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Features of SOAP**:\n",
    "- **Protocol-Based**:\n",
    "  - SOAP defines strict communication rules.\n",
    "- **Transport Neutral**:\n",
    "  - Can use protocols like HTTP, SMTP, or TCP.\n",
    "- **XML-Based**:\n",
    "  - Exclusively relies on XML for data exchange.\n",
    "- **Stateful or Stateless**:\n",
    "  - Supports both, depending on the applicationâ€™s needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Advantages of SOAP**:\n",
    "- Built-in security through WS-Security.\n",
    "- Supports complex operations and transactions.\n",
    "- Standardized approach ensures consistency.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **SOAP Example**:\n",
    "**Request**:\n",
    "```xml\n",
    "<soap:Envelope xmlns:soap=\"http://www.w3.org/2003/05/soap-envelope\">\n",
    "  <soap:Body>\n",
    "    <GetUser xmlns=\"http://example.com/\">\n",
    "      <UserId>123</UserId>\n",
    "    </GetUser>\n",
    "  </soap:Body>\n",
    "</soap:Envelope>\n",
    "```\n",
    "**Response**:\n",
    "```xml\n",
    "<soap:Envelope xmlns:soap=\"http://www.w3.org/2003/05/soap-envelope\">\n",
    "  <soap:Body>\n",
    "    <GetUserResponse xmlns=\"http://example.com/\">\n",
    "      <User>\n",
    "        <Id>123</Id>\n",
    "        <Name>Shreya Singh</Name>\n",
    "        <Email>shreya@example.com</Email>\n",
    "      </User>\n",
