    "\n",
    "**1. Which of the following is a type of statistics?**  \n",
    "\n",
    "ðŸ”² Inferential statistics  \n",
    "ðŸ”² Descriptive statistics  \n",
    "âœ… Both A and B  \n",
    "ðŸ”² None of the above  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:** Inferential statistics is used to make inferences about a population based on a sample, while descriptive statistics is used to summarize and describe the characteristics of a dataset.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. What is the difference between qualitative and quantitative data?**  \n",
    "\n",
    "ðŸ”² Qualitative data is numerical while quantitative data is non-numerical  \n",
    "âœ… Qualitative data is categorical while quantitative data is numerical  \n",
    "ðŸ”² Qualitative data is continuous while quantitative data is discrete  \n",
    "ðŸ”² There is no difference between qualitative and quantitative data  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:** Qualitative data is non-numerical and is used to describe qualities or characteristics of a population or sample, while quantitative data is numerical and is used to measure quantities or amounts.  \n",

    "ðŸ”² Mode  \n",
    "ðŸ”² Standard deviation  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:** The median is the middle value in a dataset and is less affected by outliers than the mean, which is the sum of all values divided by the number of values.  \n",
