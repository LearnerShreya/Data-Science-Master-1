    "## **1. Which feature(s) in the Wine Quality dataset exhibit non-normality?**  \n",
    "\n",
    "âœ… **Residual sugar**  \n",
    "â¬œ Fixed acidity  \n",
    "â¬œ pH  \n",
    "â¬œ Alcohol  \n",
    "\n",
    "### **Explanation:**  \n",
    "The **Residual sugar** feature exhibits **non-normality**, as confirmed by the EDA analysis.  \n",
    "- The **histogram** and **Q-Q plot** show a **non-normal distribution with a positive skew**.  \n",
    "- Other features like **fixed acidity, pH, and alcohol** exhibit normal or nearly normal distributions.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **2. Which transformation(s) can be applied to the non-normal features in the Wine Quality dataset to improve normality?**  \n",

    "â¬œ Logarithmic transformation  \n",
    "â¬œ Square root transformation  \n",
    "â¬œ Exponential transformation  \n",
    "\n",
    "### **Explanation:**  \n",
    "To improve normality in non-normal features, various transformation methods can be applied:  \n",
    "- **Logarithmic transformation** reduces skewness.  \n",
    "- **Square root transformation** is useful for moderate skewness.  \n",
    "- **Exponential transformation** can also be used in some cases.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Since all these methods can help, the correct answer is **\"All of the above.\"**\n",

    "\n",
    "### **Explanation:**  \n",
    "The **alcohol content** is the most important predictor of **wine quality**.  \n",
    "- **Higher alcohol content** is generally associated with **higher quality ratings**.  \n",
    "- Other features like **volatile acidity, sulphates, and citric acid** also play a role but are **less important**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **4. What feature(s) in the Wine Quality dataset have the highest correlation with wine quality?**  \n",

    "â¬œ Chlorides  \n",
    "â¬œ Total sulfur dioxide  \n",
    "â¬œ Citric acid  \n",
    "\n",
    "### **Explanation:**  \n",
    "According to correlation analysis, the features **Chlorides, Total sulfur dioxide, and Citric acid** have the **highest correlation** with wine quality.  \n",
    "- These features strongly impact **overall quality ratings**.  \n",
    "- Other features, like **pH, density, and residual sugar**, show **moderate correlation**.\n",

    "\n",
    "## **5. What is the purpose of feature engineering in machine learning?**  \n",
    "\n",
    "â¬œ To increase the size of the dataset  \n",
    "âœ… **To extract useful information from the raw data**  \n",
    "â¬œ To make the dataset more complex  \n",
    "â¬œ None of the above  \n",
    "\n",
    "### **Explanation:**  \n",
    "**Feature engineering** is the process of **transforming raw data** into meaningful **features** for better model performance.  \n",
    "- It **extracts useful information** and **improves predictive accuracy**.  \n",
    "- It does **not** increase dataset size or add unnecessary complexity.\n",

    "â¬œ Principal component analysis  \n",
    "â¬œ Model-based selection  \n",
    "âœ… **Feature importance ranking**  \n",
    "\n",
    "### **Explanation:**  \n",
    "**Feature importance ranking** uses **tree-based models** (e.g., Decision Trees, Random Forests) to measure the impact of each feature.  \n",
    "- Features **highly impacting** prediction accuracy are **retained**, while **irrelevant** ones are **removed**.\n",
