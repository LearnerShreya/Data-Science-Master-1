    "## **1. Introduction to Descriptive Statistics**\n",
    "\n",
    "Descriptive Statistics refers to summarizing and analyzing data to present a clear overview of its characteristics. It helps in simplifying complex data sets into understandable forms. The primary measures used in descriptive statistics include:\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Measures of Central Tendency:**\n",
    "- **Mean**: The average of all values.\n",
    "- **Median**: The middle value in an ordered dataset.\n",
    "- **Mode**: The most frequent value in a dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Measures of Dispersion:**\n",
    "- **Range**: The difference between the highest and lowest values.\n",
    "- **Variance**: Measures how far data points are from the mean, squared.\n",
    "- **Standard Deviation**: The square root of variance, indicating how spread out the data is.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Measures of Shape:**\n",
    "- **Skewness**: The asymmetry of the data distribution (whether it leans to the left, right, or is symmetric).\n",
    "- **Kurtosis**: The \"tailedness\" of a distribution or the sharpness of its peak.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **2. What is Skewness?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Skewness measures the **asymmetry** or **lopsidedness** of a distribution. It indicates if the data distribution leans towards the left or right.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Types of Skewness**:\n",
    "1. **Positive Skew (Right Skew)**\n",
    "2. **Negative Skew (Left Skew)**\n",
    "3. **Neutral Skew (Symmetric Distribution)**\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **3. Types of Skewness**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **3.1. Positive Skew (Right Skew)**\n",
    "- **Definition**: A distribution is positively skewed when the **right tail** is longer or fatter than the left.\n",
    "- **Key Point**: The **Mean** is greater than the **Median** (Mean > Median).\n",
    "- **Characteristics**:\n",
    "  - Majority of data is concentrated on the **left** side.\n",
    "  - The right tail (higher values) is more spread out.\n",
    "  - Extreme values on the higher end of the scale.\n",
    "- **Example**: Income distribution where most people earn moderate incomes, but a few earn extremely high amounts.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **3.2. Negative Skew (Left Skew)**\n",
    "- **Definition**: A distribution is negatively skewed when the **left tail** is longer or fatter than the right.\n",
    "- **Key Point**: The **Mean** is less than the **Median** (Mean < Median).\n",
    "- **Characteristics**:\n",
    "  - Majority of data is concentrated on the **right** side.\n",
    "  - The left tail (lower values) is more spread out.\n",
    "  - Extreme values on the lower end of the scale.\n",
    "- **Example**: Age at retirement where most people retire in their 60s, but a few retire earlier.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **3.3. Neutral Skew (Symmetric Distribution)**\n",
    "- **Definition**: A distribution is symmetric if the left and right sides are mirror images of each other.\n",
    "- **Key Point**: The **Mean** is equal to the **Median** (Mean = Median).\n",
    "- **Characteristics**:\n",
    "  - The distribution is **bell-shaped** (Normal Distribution).\n",

    "- **Positive Skew**: Outliers on the higher end will influence the **mean**.\n",
    "- **Negative Skew**: Outliers on the lower end will drag the **mean** downwards.\n",
    "- **Neutral/Zero Skew**: No influence on the mean or median as both are equal.\n",
