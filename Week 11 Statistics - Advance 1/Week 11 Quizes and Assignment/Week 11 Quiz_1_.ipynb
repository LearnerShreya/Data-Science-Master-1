    "**1. Which type of probability distribution is used to model the number of successes in a fixed number of independent trials?**  \n",
    "\n",
    "âœ… Binomial Distribution  \n",
    "ðŸ”² Poisson Distribution  \n",
    "ðŸ”² Normal Distribution  \n",
    "ðŸ”² Exponential Distribution  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:** The binomial distribution models the number of successes in a fixed number of independent trials, where each trial has only two possible outcomes (success or failure).  \n",

    "\n",
    "**2. Which probability distribution is used to model the number of events occurring in a fixed interval of time or space?**  \n",

    "ðŸ”² Binomial Distribution  \n",
    "âœ… Poisson Distribution  \n",
    "ðŸ”² Normal Distribution  \n",
    "ðŸ”² Exponential Distribution  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:** The Poisson distribution models the number of events occurring in a fixed interval of time or space, such as the number of cars passing through a toll booth in an hour or the number of calls received by a call center in a day.  \n",

    "**3. Which probability distribution is symmetric and bell-shaped?**  \n",

    "ðŸ”² Binomial Distribution  \n",
    "ðŸ”² Poisson Distribution  \n",
    "âœ… Normal Distribution  \n",
    "ðŸ”² Exponential Distribution  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:** The normal distribution is symmetric and bell-shaped. It is widely used to model many natural phenomena, such as the heights and weights of people and errors in measurements.  \n",

    "**4. In a binomial distribution, what is the formula for calculating the probability of k successes in n trials?**  \n",
    "\n",

    "ðŸ”² P(k) = Î»^k * e^(-Î») / k!  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:** This is the formula for calculating the probability of k successes in n trials, where \\( p \\) is the probability of success, and \\( (1-p) \\) is the probability of failure.  \n",

    "ðŸ”² P(k) = Î»^k * e^(-Î») / k!  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:** This is the formula for calculating the probability of \\( k \\) events occurring in a fixed time interval, where \\( Î» \\) is the expected number of events in that time interval.  \n",

    "**6. In a normal distribution, what is the percentage of data that falls within one standard deviation of the mean?**  \n",
    "\n",
    "âœ… 68%  \n",
    "ðŸ”² 95%  \n",
    "ðŸ”² 99.7%  \n",
    "ðŸ”² 100%  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:** In a normal distribution, approximately 68% of the data falls within one standard deviation of the mean, following the empirical rule (68-95-99.7 rule).  \n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**7. In a binomial distribution, what happens to the shape of the distribution as the number of trials increases?**  \n",
    "\n",
    "ðŸ”² It becomes wider  \n",
    "âœ… It becomes narrower  \n",
    "ðŸ”² It becomes taller  \n",
    "ðŸ”² It becomes flatter  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:** As the number of trials in a binomial distribution increases, the shape of the distribution becomes narrower and more concentrated around the expected value due to the law of large numbers.  \n",

    "\n",
    "**8. In a Poisson distribution, what happens to the shape of the distribution as the mean increases?**  \n",

    "ðŸ”² It becomes narrower  \n",
    "ðŸ”² It becomes taller  \n",
    "ðŸ”² It becomes flatter  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:** As the mean of a Poisson distribution increases, the distribution becomes wider because the variance increases with the mean, making the spread of possible values larger.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**PW ans : âœ… It becomes taller**  \n",
    "**Explanation:** As the mean of a Poisson distribution increases, the shape of the distribution becomes taller\n",
