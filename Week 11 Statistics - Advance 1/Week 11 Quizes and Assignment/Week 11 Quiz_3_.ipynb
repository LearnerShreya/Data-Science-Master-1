    "\n",
    "**1. What is a hypothesis in statistics?**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **✅ A guess about the outcome of an experiment.**  \n",
    "  *(Correct: A hypothesis is an assumption or prediction about the outcome of an experiment or study.)*\n",
    "\n",
    "- **A proven fact.**  \n",
    "  *(Incorrect: A hypothesis is not a proven fact; it is an assumption that needs to be tested.)*\n",
    "\n",
    "- **A random number generator.**  \n",
    "  *(Incorrect: A hypothesis has nothing to do with random number generation.)*\n",
    "\n",
    "- **A programming language.**  \n",
    "  *(Incorrect: A hypothesis is not related to programming languages.)*\n",

    "**2. What is the mechanism of hypothesis testing?**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Analyzing data.**  \n",
    "  *(Partially correct: Analyzing data is one step in hypothesis testing, but it is not the entire mechanism.)*\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Conducting experiments.**  \n",
    "  *(Partially correct: Conducting experiments is part of the process, but it is not the entire mechanism.)*\n",
    "\n",
    "- **✅ Formulating a null and alternative hypothesis.**  \n",
    "  *(Correct: The mechanism of hypothesis testing involves formulating a null hypothesis (which assumes there is no effect or relationship between variables) and an alternative hypothesis (which assumes there is an effect or relationship).)*\n",
    "\n",
    "- **All of the above.**  \n",
    "  *(Incorrect: While all these steps are part of hypothesis testing, the core mechanism is specifically about formulating hypotheses.)*\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:** The mechanism of hypothesis testing involves formulating a null hypothesis (which assumes there is no effect or relationship between variables) and an alternative hypothesis (which assumes there is an effect or relationship), collecting data, analyzing the data, and determining whether the null hypothesis can be rejected or not.\n",

    "\n",
    "- **✅ 0.05.**  \n",
    "  *(Correct: The significance level commonly used in hypothesis testing is 0.05, which means there is a 5% chance of rejecting the null hypothesis when it is actually true.)*\n",
    "\n",
    "- **0.10.**  \n",
    "  *(Incorrect: While 0.10 is sometimes used, it is not the most common significance level.)*\n",

    "- **0.25.**  \n",
    "  *(Incorrect: 0.25 is rarely used as a significance level in hypothesis testing.)*\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:** The significance level commonly used in hypothesis testing is 0.05, which means there is a 5% chance of rejecting the null hypothesis when it is actually true. This level of significance is considered the standard in many fields.\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Which of the following is a statement that is being tested in hypothesis testing?**\n",

    "  *(Correct: In hypothesis testing, the null hypothesis is the statement that is being tested against the alternative hypothesis.)*\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Alternative hypothesis.**  \n",
    "  *(Incorrect: The alternative hypothesis is the statement that is accepted if the null hypothesis is rejected, but it is not the one being tested.)*\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Alternative reality.**  \n",
    "  *(Incorrect: \"Alternative reality\" is not a term used in hypothesis testing.)*\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:** In hypothesis testing, the null hypothesis is a statement that is being tested against the alternative hypothesis to determine whether there is evidence to reject the null hypothesis.\n",

    "**5. What is estimation in statistics?**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **A method used to test hypotheses about a population parameter.**  \n",
    "  *(Incorrect: Estimation is not about testing hypotheses; it is about inferring population parameters from sample data.)*\n",
    "\n",
    "- **✅ The process of drawing conclusions about a population based on sample data.**  \n",
    "  *(Correct: Estimation in statistics is the process of drawing conclusions about a population based on sample data.)*\n",
    "\n",
    "- **The process of calculating the mean and standard deviation of a population.**  \n",
    "  *(Incorrect: Estimation is not limited to calculating the mean and standard deviation; it involves inferring population parameters.)*\n",
    "\n",
    "- **The process of collecting data from a population.**  \n",
    "  *(Incorrect: Estimation is not about collecting data; it is about using sample data to infer population parameters.)*\n",

    "\n",
    "- **The probability of rejecting the null hypothesis.**  \n",
