    "## 🔹 What is it?\n",
    "The **Binomial Distribution** models the number of **successes** in a fixed number of **independent** trials, where each trial has only **two possible outcomes**:\n",
    "- ✅ **Success** (1)\n",
    "- ❌ **Failure** (0)\n",
    "\n",
    "Common examples include:\n",
    "- Flipping a coin multiple times 🪙  \n",
    "- Checking for defective products in a batch 🔍  \n",
    "- Predicting the success rate of a marketing campaign 📢  \n",

    "## 🔹 Formula  \n",
    "The probability of getting exactly **k** successes in **n** trials is:\n",
    "\n",
    "**P(X = k) = C(n, k) p<sup>k</sup> (1 - p)<sup>(n - k)</sup>**\n",

    "## 🔹 Example: Coin Toss 🎲\n",
    "Suppose you flip a **fair coin** **5 times** (**n = 5**) and want to find the probability of getting **exactly 3 heads** (**k = 3**).  \n",
    "\n",
    "- Since the coin is fair, the probability of heads is **p = 0.5**.  \n",
    "- Using the binomial formula:\n",
    "\n",
    "  **P(X = 3) = C(5, 3) (0.5)<sup>3</sup> (0.5)<sup>2</sup>**  \n",
    "\n",
    "  **= (5! / (3!(5 - 3)!)) × (0.5)<sup>5</sup>**  \n",
    "\n",
    "  **= (5 × 4) / (2 × 1) × 0.03125**  \n",
    "\n",
    "  **= 10 × 0.03125**  \n",
    "\n",
    "  **= 0.3125 (or 31.25%)**  \n",
    "\n",
    "So, the probability of getting exactly **3 heads in 5 flips** is **31.25%**.\n",

    "## 🔹 Real-World Applications  \n",
    "✅ **Quality Control** 🏭 (Checking defective items in production)  \n",
    "✅ **Medical Studies** 🏥 (Success rate of a treatment)  \n",
    "✅ **Sports Analytics** ⚽ (Probability of a player scoring goals)  \n",

    "## 💡 Key Takeaways  \n",
    "✔ Use the Binomial Distribution when you have **fixed trials, independent events, and only two outcomes per trial**.  \n",
    "✔ If **p = 0.5**, the distribution is **symmetric** (like a fair coin).  \n",
    "✔ If **p** is small or large, the distribution becomes **skewed**.  \n"
