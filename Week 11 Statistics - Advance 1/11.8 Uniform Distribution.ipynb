    "# **Uniform Distribution**\n",
    "\n",
    "A **Uniform Distribution** is a probability distribution where all outcomes are equally likely. There are two types:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Discrete Uniform Distribution** (for finite outcomes) `PMF`\n",
    "2. **Continuous Uniform Distribution** (for infinite outcomes in a range) `PDF`\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Key Points**:\n",
    "- Every value in a **uniform distribution** has an equal chance of happening.\n",
    "- In the discrete type, this applies to a finite set of numbers.\n",
    "- In the continuous type, this applies to all real numbers between two limits.\n",

    "## **Discrete Uniform Distribution**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Definition**:\n",
    "In a **discrete uniform distribution**, there are a set number of possible outcomes, and each one has the same probability.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Formula**:\n",
    "If there are **n** outcomes (e.g., 1, 2, 3, ..., n), the probability of each outcome is:\n",

    "In a **continuous uniform distribution**, the probability is evenly spread across an interval [a, b] (e.g., between 0 and 10). Every point in this interval has the same probability density.\n",

    "f(x) = \\frac{1}{10}, \\quad 0 \\leq x \\leq 10\n",
