    "\n",
    "The **p-value** is a fundamental concept in statistical hypothesis testing. It quantifies the probability of obtaining a test statistic as extreme or more extreme than the observed value, assuming that the **null hypothesis (H‚ÇÄ)** is true. The p-value helps us decide whether to **reject or fail to reject** the null hypothesis.\n",
