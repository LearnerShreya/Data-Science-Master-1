    "\n",
    "- **Answer:** B. `.infile = open(“c:\\\\scores.txt”, “r”)`\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Explanation:** Double backslashes (`\\\\`) are required to escape the backslash in file paths. Execute `help(open)` for more details.\n",

    "### 2. Which of the following statements are true?\n",
    "- **Options:**\n",
    "  - A. When you open a file for reading, if the file does not exist, an error occurs.\n",

    "\n",
    "- **Answer:** D. All of the mentioned.\n",
    "\n",

    "  - D. `datatype`\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Answer:** B. `module`\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Explanation:** The `logging` module provides ready-to-use functionality for creating log messages and is widely used in Python applications. It is a powerful module that is designed to meet the needs of beginners as well as enterprise teams. It is used by most of the third-party Python libraries, so you can integrate your log messages with the ones from those libraries to produce a homogeneous log for your application.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. Which one of the following is the lowest level of logging?\n",
    "- **Options:**\n",

    "  - C. `error`\n",
    "  - D. `none of the above`\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Answer:** A. `debug`\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Explanation:** `debug` is the lowest logging level, typically used for diagnostic information about the application.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7. Which of the following is not a logging function in Python?\n",
    "- **Options:**\n",

    "  - B. `filter`\n",
    "  - C. `critical`\n",
    "  - D. `All the above`\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Answer:** B. `filter`\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Explanation:** `filter` is not a logging function but a concept to control the flow of log messages. It is implemented using the `addFilter` method. \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 8. Which of these is not involved in the process of debugging?\n",
    "- **Options:**\n",

    "  - C. `Identifying`\n",
    "  - D. `Testing`\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Answer:** D. `Testing`\n",

    "  - C. `Import the module into a Python program`\n",
    "  - D. `None of the above`\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Answer:** C. `Import the module into a Python program`\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Explanation:** The `import` statement allows access to all definitions within a module.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Explanation:** The import statement is used to import a module into a Python program, allowing you to use its definitions and statements. By using the import statement, you can access all the variables, functions, and classes defined in the imported module. You can then use them in your program as if they were defined locally.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 10. How can you reload a module in Python?\n",
    "- **Options:**\n",
    "  - A. `importlib.reload function`\n",
    "  - B. `import reload`\n",
    "  - C. `import logging`\n",
    "  - D. `None of the above`\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Answer:** A. `importlib.reload function`\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Explanation:** `importlib.reload` allows reloading an already imported module, useful during module development.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Explanation:** The importlib.reload function reloads a previously imported module, allowing you to pick up changes that have been made to the module's code. This is useful in situations where you are developing a module and need to test changes without restarting your program.\n",

    "  - D. `FileBufferStream`\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Answer:** C. `BufferedOutputStream`\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Explanation:** In Java, the FileOutputStream and FileWriter classes can be used to write to a file. The BufferedOutputStream class provides a buffering layer on top of an OutputStream, which can improve performance when writing to a file.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Explanation:** In Java, `BufferedOutputStream` improves performance when writing to a file by buffering data.\n"
