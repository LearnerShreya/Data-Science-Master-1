    "\n",
    "1. **Global Interpreter Lock (GIL)**:  \n",
    "   - Python uses GIL, which allows only one thread to execute Python bytecode at a time in a single process.  \n",
    "   - This means CPU-bound tasks (e.g., computations) don't benefit from multithreading.  \n",
    "   - However, I/O-bound tasks (e.g., file I/O, database queries, or API calls) can benefit from multithreading as GIL is released during I/O operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Use Cases for Multithreading**:  \n",
    "   - Ideal for I/O-bound tasks like network operations, file downloads, or user interface responsiveness.  \n",
    "   - Not suitable for CPU-intensive tasks (use `multiprocessing` for such tasks).\n",

    "\n",
    "1. **I/O-Bound Tasks**:  \n",
    "   - File operations, web scraping, database queries, etc.  \n",
    "   - Improves responsiveness and reduces latency.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **CPU-Bound Tasks**:  \n",
    "   - For tasks like mathematical computations or data processing, use the `multiprocessing` module instead of `threading`.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Points to Remember:\n",
    "- **GIL and Multithreading**: Python threads don't run in true parallelism due to GIL but can still be effective for I/O-bound operations.  \n",
    "- **Concurrency**: Focus on improving concurrency for tasks that involve waiting (like I/O).  \n",
    "- **Thread Safety**: Use locks (`threading.Lock`) or higher-level synchronization mechanisms when accessing shared resources.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion:\n",
    "Python's multithreading is primarily beneficial for I/O-bound operations. For true parallelism in CPU-bound tasks, consider using the `multiprocessing` module. Understanding how to work with threads, locks, and synchronization is crucial for writing efficient and safe concurrent programs."

    "### 1. **Context Switching Overhead**  \n",
    "   - When multiple threads compete for CPU time, the frequent saving and loading of thread states (context switching) adds overhead.  \n",
    "   - If context switching is too frequent, it can degrade performance significantly.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Synchronization Issues**  \n",
    "   - Threads accessing shared resources (e.g., a variable) may cause race conditions or deadlocks. To prevent this, locks or synchronization mechanisms are used, which can slow down execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **I/O Wait**  \n",
    "   - If a thread is waiting for I/O (e.g., file read/write), the core remains idle for that thread, wasting potential CPU cycles.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. **Cache Misses**  \n",
    "   - Each thread may require different data, leading to frequent cache invalidation and reloads, which slow down performance.\n",

    "3. **Efficient Locking**:\n",
    "   - Use minimal locking to avoid unnecessary blocking of threads.\n",

    "\n",
    "- **Multithreading** on a single core involves concurrency, not true parallelism.\n",
    "- It is managed through time-slicing and context switching.\n",
    "- Bottlenecks occur due to synchronization, overheads, or resource contention.\n",
