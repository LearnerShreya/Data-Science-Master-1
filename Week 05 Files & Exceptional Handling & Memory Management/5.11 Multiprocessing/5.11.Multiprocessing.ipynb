    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **Importing the `multiprocessing` Module**\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   import multiprocessing\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   - **Purpose**: The `multiprocessing` module in Python allows you to create and manage multiple processes, enabling parallel execution of tasks.\n",
    "   - **Why Use It?**: Processes are independent of each other, so you can perform heavy computations or tasks concurrently without being affected by Python's Global Interpreter Lock (GIL).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Defining the `test` Function**\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   def test():\n",
    "       print(\"This is my multiprocessing program\")\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   - **What It Does**: \n",
    "     - This is the function that will be executed in a separate process. \n",
    "     - When called, it prints `\"This is my multiprocessing program\"`.\n",
    "   - **Why Use a Function?**: \n",
    "     - Multiprocessing requires the target task to be defined as a callable (e.g., a function). This makes it reusable and modular.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **The `if __name__ == '__main__':` Block**\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   if __name__ == '__main__':\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   - **What It Does**: \n",
    "     - This block ensures the code within it runs only when the script is executed directly, not when it is imported as a module.\n",
    "   - **Why It’s Important?**: \n",
    "     - On platforms like Windows, a new Python interpreter is launched for every child process. Without this block, the script might recursively create processes, leading to an infinite loop or crash.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. **Creating a Process**\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   m = multiprocessing.Process(target=test)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   - **What It Does**:\n",
    "     - A new process object `m` is created using `multiprocessing.Process`.\n",
    "     - `target=test`: Specifies the function `test` to run in the new process.\n",
    "   - **How It Works**:\n",
    "     - The `Process` class spawns a new process, which is an independent instance of the Python interpreter. The `target` function will execute in this new process.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. **Printing in the Main Process**\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   print(\"This is my main program\")\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   - **What It Does**: \n",
    "     - Prints `\"This is my main program\"` to the console.\n",
    "     - This statement runs in the main process, not in the new process.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. **Starting the Process**\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   m.start()\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   - **What It Does**:\n",
    "     - Starts the new process `m`.\n",
    "     - The `test` function is now executed in the new process.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7. **Waiting for the Process to Finish**\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   m.join()\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   - **What It Does**:\n",
    "     - Pauses the execution of the main program until the `test` process completes.\n",
    "   - **Why Use `join`?**:\n",
    "     - It ensures the main process waits for the child process to finish before continuing execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Flow of Execution:\n",
    "1. **Main Program Begins**:\n",
    "   - The script prints `\"This is my main program\"`.\n",
    "2. **Process Starts**:\n",
    "   - A new process is created, and it begins executing the `test` function.\n",
    "3. **Child Process Runs**:\n",
    "   - The child process prints `\"This is my multiprocessing program\"`.\n",
    "4. **Join Ensures Synchronization**:\n",
    "   - The main program waits for the child process to complete before exiting.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Output:\n",
    "```\n",
    "This is my main program\n",
    "This is my multiprocessing program\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Concepts:\n",
    "1. **Concurrency with Multiprocessing**:\n",
    "   - Each process has its own memory space, meaning variables and states are not shared by default.\n",
    "   - This makes multiprocessing suitable for CPU-bound tasks, such as heavy computations.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Process Lifecycle**:\n",
    "   - **Created**: The process object is instantiated (`multiprocessing.Process`).\n",
    "   - **Started**: The `start()` method spawns the process.\n",
    "   - **Running**: The `target` function executes in the new process.\n",
    "   - **Finished**: The process completes execution, and control returns to the main process.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Benefits of Multiprocessing**:\n",
    "   - Utilizes multiple CPU cores.\n",
    "   - Avoids limitations of Python’s GIL, unlike threads.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Cautions**:\n",
    "   - Always use `if __name__ == '__main__':` to avoid unintended behavior, especially on Windows.\n",
    "\n",
    "By following this structure, you create a simple but effective multiprocessing program!"

    "### 1. **Importing the `multiprocessing` Module**\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   import multiprocessing\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   - The `multiprocessing` module allows you to create and manage multiple processes.\n",
    "   - Here, we are using the `Pool` class to efficiently distribute tasks among a pool of worker processes.\n",

    "   ```\n",
    "   - **What It Does**:\n",
    "     - This function computes the square of a given number `n`.\n",
    "     - For example, `square(3)` returns `9`.\n",
    "   - **Purpose**:\n",

    "   if __name__ == '__main__':\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   - **Purpose**:\n",
    "     - Ensures the code is executed only when the script is run directly, not when it is imported as a module.\n",
    "   - **Why It’s Critical**:\n",
    "     - On Windows and macOS, this prevents unintended recursive spawning of processes caused by the multiprocessing module.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. **Creating a Pool of Processes**\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   with multiprocessing.Pool(processes=4) as pool:\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   - **What It Does**:\n",
    "     - Creates a pool of worker processes. Here, the pool has `4` processes (`processes=4`), meaning up to 4 tasks can be executed simultaneously.\n",
    "     - The `with` statement ensures the pool is properly closed when its work is done, releasing system resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Why Use a Pool?**:\n",
    "     - It simplifies parallel processing by automatically distributing tasks among worker processes.\n",
    "     - Efficiently manages worker processes and minimizes overhead.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",

    "### 5. **Distributing Tasks Using `pool.map`**\n",

    "   ```\n",
    "   - **What It Does**:\n",
    "     - `pool.map` applies the `square` function to each element of the list `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]`.\n",
    "     - Each element is processed by a worker process.\n",
    "     - The results are returned in a list that matches the order of the input.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **How It Works**:\n",
    "     - The input list is divided into chunks and distributed among the worker processes.\n",
    "     - Each worker computes the square of its assigned numbers and returns the results.\n",
    "     - The results are collected and combined into a single list, preserving the input order.\n",

    "     - Prints the list of squared values returned by `pool.map`.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Execution Flow:\n",
    "1. **Main Program Starts**:\n",
    "   - A process pool with 4 worker processes is created.\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. **Tasks Are Distributed**:\n",
    "   - The input list `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]` is divided into chunks.\n",
    "   - Each chunk is sent to a worker process, which computes the square of its assigned numbers.\n",

    "3. **Results Are Gathered**:\n",
    "   - The squared results from all workers are collected and combined into a single list.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Output Is Printed**:\n",
    "   - The final output is displayed.\n",

    "### Key Concepts:\n",
    "1. **Parallel Processing**:\n",
    "   - Instead of computing all squares sequentially, the tasks are distributed among 4 worker processes.\n",
    "   - This speeds up computation for large datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Order Preservation**:\n",
    "   - `pool.map` ensures the order of the input list is preserved in the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Automatic Resource Management**:\n",

    "\n",
    "4. **Customizable Number of Processes**:\n",
    "   - `processes=4` specifies the number of worker processes. You can adjust this based on the number of CPU cores or the workload.\n",

    "### 1. **Issues in the Code**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### a. **Inconsistent Producer-Consumer Workflow**\n",
    "- The `queue.put(\"sudh\")` is added in the main process but is unrelated to the producer function. This will result in `\"sudh\"` being printed by the consumer, which may not align with the intended logic.\n",

    "#### b. **Missing Sentinel Handling**\n",
    "- The consumer function (`consume`) depends on encountering a `None` value in the queue to terminate its infinite loop. However:\n",
    "  - The producer does not insert a sentinel (`None`) into the queue to signal the end of production.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### c. **Race Condition Possibility**\n",
    "- Since the producer and consumer processes run in parallel, if the `queue.put(\"sudh\")` is executed before the consumer starts processing, unexpected behavior may occur.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### d. **Deadlock Possibility**\n",

    "- **Purpose**: Produces items (`0-9`) and places them in the queue.\n",
    "- **Sentinel (`None`)**: Indicates the end of production to the consumer.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### c. **Consumer Function**\n",

    "```\n",
    "- Waits for both processes to complete before terminating the main program.\n",
