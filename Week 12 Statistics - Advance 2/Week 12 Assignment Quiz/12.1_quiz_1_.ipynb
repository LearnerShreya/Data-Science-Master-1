    "### Quiz: Statistics Advance Quiz - 4  \n",
    "**7 out of 7 correct**  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. What is the main difference between t-tests and z-tests?**  \n",
    "⬜ T-tests require a larger sample size than z-tests  \n",
    "⬜ T-tests assume a known population variance while z-tests assume an unknown population variance  \n",
    "⬜ Z-tests are used for testing two population means while t-tests are used for testing one population mean  \n",
    "✅ **T-tests are used when the sample size is small and/or the population variance is unknown, while z-tests are used when the sample size is large and/or the population variance is known.**  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:** T-tests are suitable for small sample sizes or when the population variance is unknown. Z-tests are used for large sample sizes or when the population variance is known.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. In hypothesis testing, what is a Type 1 error?**  \n",
    "✅ **Rejecting a true null hypothesis**  \n",
    "⬜ Failing to reject a false null hypothesis  \n",
    "⬜ Rejecting a false alternative hypothesis  \n",
    "⬜ Failing to reject a true alternative hypothesis  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:** A Type 1 error occurs when the null hypothesis is true, but we incorrectly reject it. The probability of a Type 1 error is denoted by alpha (α), typically set at 0.05 or 0.01.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. What is the margin of error in a confidence interval?**  \n",
    "⬜ The width of the confidence interval  \n",
    "✅ **The maximum amount a point estimate can be off from the true population parameter**  \n",
    "⬜ The probability of making a Type 1 error  \n",
    "⬜ The probability of making a Type 2 error  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:** The margin of error quantifies the precision of a point estimate, representing the maximum deviation from the true population parameter at a given confidence level.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. A researcher wants to compare the mean weight of two different groups of mice. One group has a sample size of 25 and the other group has a sample size of 50. Which test should the researcher use to compare the means?**  \n",
    "✅ **T-test**  \n",
    "⬜ Z-test  \n",
    "⬜ Both tests can be used  \n",
    "⬜ Neither test can be used  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:** When comparing means of two independent groups with small or moderate sample sizes and unknown population variance, a t-test is appropriate.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**5. A researcher wants to estimate the probability of a hypothesis based on new evidence. Which statistical tool should they use?**  \n",
    "⬜ T-test  \n",
    "⬜ Z-test  \n",
    "✅ **Bayes theorem**  \n",
    "⬜ Confidence interval  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:** Bayes theorem is used in Bayesian statistics to update the probability of a hypothesis based on new evidence, allowing for more accurate predictions.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**6. A researcher wants to compare the mean height of two different groups of plants. One group has a sample size of 15 and the other group has a sample size of 20. The population variance is known to be 9. Which test should the researcher use to compare the means?**  \n",
    "⬜ T-test  \n",
    "✅ **Z-test**  \n",
    "⬜ Both tests can be used  \n",
    "⬜ Neither test can be used  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:** When the population variance is known and the sample sizes are not very small, a z-test is appropriate for comparing the means of two independent groups.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**7. A confidence interval is calculated for a sample mean with a sample size of 100 and a standard deviation of 10. The 95% confidence interval is found to be between 25 and 30. What is the margin of error?**  \n",
    "✅ **2.5**  \n",
    "⬜ 5  \n",
    "⬜ 7.5  \n",
    "⬜ 10  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:** The margin of error is half the width of the confidence interval. Here, the width is 30 - 25 = 5, so the margin of error is 5 / 2 = 2.5.  \n"
