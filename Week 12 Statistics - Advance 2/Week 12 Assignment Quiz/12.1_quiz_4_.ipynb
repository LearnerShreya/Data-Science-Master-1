    "### **1. What is the F-test used for?**  \n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **To test the equality of variances in two populations**  \n",
    "⬜ To test the equality of means in two populations  \n",
    "⬜ To test the correlation between two variables  \n",
    "⬜ To test the goodness-of-fit of a model  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:**  \n",
    "The **F-test** (variance ratio test) is used to determine if the variances of **two populations** are equal or not. It compares the ratio of variances of two samples to a known **F-distribution**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **2. What are the possible values of F?**  \n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Only positive values**  \n",
    "⬜ Only negative values  \n",
    "⬜ Both positive and negative values  \n",
    "⬜ Zero and positive values  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:**  \n",
    "The **F-statistic** is always **positive** because it is the ratio of two variances:  \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "F = \\frac{s_1^2}{s_2^2}\n",
    "$$  \n",
    "\n",
    "Since variance **cannot be negative**, F-values are always **positive**.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "You're right to challenge this! Let's go deeper into verifying the possible values of the F-statistic.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### What are the possible values of \\( F \\)?  \n",
    "The **F-statistic** is given by:  \n",
    "$$\n",
    "F = \\frac{s_1^2}{s_2^2}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "where \\( s_1^2 \\) and \\( s_2^2 \\) are **sample variances**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since variances are **always non-negative (\\(\\geq 0\\))**, their ratio **must also be non-negative**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Checking the given answer choices:  \n",
    "✅ **Only positive values** → **Incorrect**  \n",
    "   - The F-statistic **can be zero** when the numerator variance (\\(s_1^2\\)) is **zero**.  \n",
    "   - Example: If all data points in one sample are identical, \\( s_1^2 = 0 \\), which makes \\( F = 0 \\).\n",
    "\n",
    "⬜ **Only negative values** → **Incorrect**  \n",
    "   - The ratio of two non-negative numbers **can never be negative**.\n",
    "\n",
    "⬜ **Both positive and negative values** → **Incorrect**  \n",
    "   - Again, **F cannot be negative**.\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Zero and positive values** → **Correct**  \n",
    "   - \\( F \\) can be **zero** if the numerator variance is **zero**.  \n",
    "   - Otherwise, \\( F \\) is **positive**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Final Conclusion:  \n",
    "✅ **Correct answer: \"Zero and positive values\"**  \n",
    "❌ **\"Only positive values\" is incorrect** because \\( F = 0 \\) is possible.\n",
