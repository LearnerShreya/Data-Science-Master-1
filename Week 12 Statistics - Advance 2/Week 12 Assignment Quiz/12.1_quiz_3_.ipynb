    "**Score: 7 out of 7 correct**  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Which of the following is NOT an assumption to use ANOVA?**  \n",
    "\n",
    "   - ✅ **Equidistant data points**  \n",
    "   - Homogeneity of variance  \n",
    "   - Independence of observations  \n",
    "   - Normality of residuals  \n",
    "\n",
    "   **Explanation:** The assumption of equidistant data points is not required for ANOVA. The primary assumptions are homogeneity of variance, independence of observations, and normality of residuals.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Which type of ANOVA is appropriate when there is only one factor being tested?**  \n",
    "\n",
    "   - ✅ **One-Way ANOVA**  \n",
    "   - Two-Way ANOVA  \n",
    "   - Three-Way ANOVA  \n",
    "   - Factorial ANOVA  \n",
    "\n",
    "   **Explanation:** One-Way ANOVA is used when there is only one independent variable (factor) being tested for its effect on a dependent variable.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Which term in the ANOVA table represents the amount of variation due to differences between groups?**  \n",
    "\n",
    "   - Within Groups  \n",
    "   - Total  \n",
    "   - ✅ **Between Groups**  \n",
    "   - Error  \n",
    "\n",
    "   **Explanation:** The \"Between Groups\" term in the ANOVA table represents the amount of variation caused by differences between groups. This is used to determine if there is a significant difference between the group means.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Which Python library can be used to perform ANOVA?**  \n",
    "\n",
    "   - NumPy  \n",
    "   - Pandas  \n",
    "   - ✅ **SciPy**  \n",
    "   - Matplotlib  \n",
    "\n",
    "   **Explanation:** The SciPy library in Python provides statistical functions, including those for performing ANOVA calculations, such as `scipy.stats.f_oneway`.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **What percentage of the total variation in the response variable is explained by the differences between groups in ANOVA?**  \n",
    "\n",
    "   - Between Groups Variance / Total Variance  \n",
    "   - Within Groups Variance / Total Variance  \n",
    "   - ✅ **Between Groups Variance / (Between Groups Variance + Within Groups Variance)**  \n",
    "   - Within Groups Variance / (Between Groups Variance + Within Groups Variance)  \n",
    "\n",
    "   **Explanation:** The proportion of total variation explained by differences between groups is calculated as:  \n",
    "   \\[\n",
    "   R^2 = \\frac{\\text{Between Groups Variance}}{\\text{Between Groups Variance} + \\text{Within Groups Variance}}\n",
    "   \\]  \n",
    "   This is also known as the **coefficient of determination** in ANOVA.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **In a One-Way ANOVA with 4 groups, what degrees of freedom are associated with the Within Groups sum of squares?**  \n",
    "\n",
    "   - 1  \n",
    "   - 2  \n",
    "   - 3  \n",
    "   - ✅ **4**  \n",
    "\n",
    "   **Explanation:** In a One-Way ANOVA with \\( k \\) groups, the degrees of freedom for the **Within Groups sum of squares** is calculated as:  \n",
    "   \\[\n",
    "   df_{\\text{within}} = N - k\n",
    "   \\]  \n",
    "   where \\( N \\) is the total number of observations and \\( k \\) is the number of groups.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **In Python, which function from the SciPy library is used to perform One-Way ANOVA calculations?**  \n",
    "\n",
    "   - `scipy.stats.ttest_ind`  \n",
    "   - ✅ **`scipy.stats.f_oneway`**  \n",
    "   - `scipy.stats.chisquare`  \n",
    "   - `scipy.stats.mannwhitneyu`  \n",
    "\n",
    "   **Explanation:** The `scipy.stats.f_oneway` function from the SciPy library is used to perform a One-Way ANOVA, which determines if there are statistically significant differences between the means of multiple groups.  \n",
